Four key metrics,adopt,techniques,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,"<p>The thorough <a href=""https://devops-research.com/research.html"">State of DevOps</a> reports have focused on data-driven and statistical analysis of high-performing organizations. The result of this multiyear research, published in <a href=""https://itrevolution.com/book/accelerate/"">Accelerate</a>, demonstrates a direct link between organizational performance and software delivery performance. The researchers have determined that only <strong>four key metrics</strong> differentiate between low, medium and high performers: lead time, deployment frequency, mean time to restore (MTTR) and change fail percentage. Indeed, we've found that these four key metrics are a simple and yet powerful tool to help leaders and teams focus on measuring and improving what matters. A good place to start is to instrument the build pipelines so you can capture the four key metrics and make the software delivery value stream visible. <a href=""https://www.gocd.org/"">GoCD pipelines,</a> for example, provide the ability to measure these four key metrics as a first-class citizen of the <a href=""https://www.gocd.org/analytics.html"">GoCD analytics</a>.</p>"
Micro frontends,adopt,techniques,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,"<p>We've seen significant benefits from introducing <a href=""https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html"">microservices</a>, which have allowed teams to scale the delivery of independently deployed and maintained services. Unfortunately, we've also seen many teams create a frontend monolith — a large, entangled browser application that sits on top of the backend services — largely neutralizing the benefits of microservices. Since we first described <strong>micro frontends</strong> as a technique to address this issue, we've had almost universally positive experiences with the approach and have found a number of patterns to use micro frontends even as more and more code shifts from the server to the web browser. So far, <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/web-components-standard"">web components</a> have been elusive in this field, though.</p>"
Opinionated and automated code formatting,adopt,techniques,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"<p>For as long as we can remember, what style to use for formatting code has been a matter of personal taste, company policy and heated debate. Finally, the industry appears to be tiring of this endless argument and teams are freeing up surprisingly large amounts of time by forgoing these discussions and just adopting <strong>opinionated and automated code formatting</strong> tools. Even if you don't agree 100% with the opinions of the various tools, the benefits of focusing on what your code does rather than how it looks is something most teams should be able to get behind. <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/tools/prettier"">Prettier</a> has been getting our vote for JavaScript, but similar tools, such as <a href=""https://github.com/ambv/black"">Black</a> for Python, are available for many other languages and are increasingly being built-in as we see with <a href=""https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/"">Golang</a> and <a href=""https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2018/01/17/elixir-v1-6-0-released/"">Elixir</a>. The key here is not to spend hours discussing which rules to enforce, but instead pick a tool that is opinionated, minimally configurable and automated — ideally as a pre-commit hook.</p>"
Polyglot programming,adopt,techniques,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,"<p>We put <strong>polyglot programming</strong> on Trial in one of our first Radars to suggest that choosing the right language for the job could significantly boost productivity, and there were new language entrants that were worthy of consideration. We want to reraise this suggestion because we're seeing a new push to standardize language stacks by both developers and enterprises. While we acknowledge that placing no restrictions on language uses can create more problems than it solves, promoting a few languages that support different ecosystems or language features is important for both enterprises to accelerate processes and go live more quickly and developers to have the right tools to solve the problem at hand.</p>"
Secrets as a service,adopt,techniques,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,"<p>Humans and machines use secrets throughout the value stream of building and operating software. The build pipelines need secrets to interface with secure infrastructures such as container registries, the applications use API keys as secrets to get access to business capabilities, and the service-to-service communications are secured using certificates and keys as secrets. You can set and retrieve these secrets in different ways. We've long cautioned developers about using source code management for storing secrets. We've recommended <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/decoupling-secret-management-from-source-code"">decoupling secret management from source code</a> and using tools such as <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/tools/git-secrets"">git-secrets</a> and <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/tools/talisman"">Talisman</a> to avoid storing secrets in the source code. We've been using <strong>secrets as a service</strong> as a default technique for storing and accessing secrets. With this technique you can use tools such as <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/tools/hashicorp-vault"">Vault</a> or <a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/kms/"">AWS Key Management Service (KMS)</a> to read/write secrets over an HTTPS endpoint with fine-grained levels of access control. Secrets as a service uses external identity providers such as <a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/iam/"">AWS IAM</a> to identify the actors who request access to secrets. Actors authenticate themselves with the secrets service. For this process to work, it's important to automate bootstrapping the identity of the actors, services and applications. Platforms based on <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/spiffe"">SPIFFE</a> have improved the automation of assigning identities to services.</p>"
Chaos Engineering,trial,techniques,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"<p>In the last year we've seen <strong>Chaos Engineering</strong> move from a much talked-about idea to an accepted, mainstream approach to improving and assuring distributed system resilience. As organizations large and small begin to implement Chaos Engineering as an operational process, we're learning how to apply these techniques safely at scale. The approach is definitely not for everyone, and to be effective and safe, it requires organizational support at scale. Industry acceptance and available expertise will definitely increase with the appearance of commercial services such as <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/tools/gremlin"">Gremlin</a> and deployment tools such as <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/tools/spinnaker"">Spinnaker</a> implementing some Chaos Engineering tools.</p>"
Container security scanning,trial,techniques,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,"<p>The container revolution around <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/docker"">Docker</a> has massively reduced the friction in moving applications between environments, fueling increased adoption of continuous delivery and continuous deployments. The latter, especially, has blown a rather large hole in the traditional controls over what can go to production. The technique of <strong>container security scanning</strong> is a necessary response to this threat vector. Tools in the build pipeline automatically check containers flowing through the pipeline against known vulnerabilities. Since our first mention of this technique, the tool landscape has matured and the technique has proven useful on development efforts with our clients.</p>"
Continuous delivery for machine learning (CD4ML),trial,techniques,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"<p><strong>Continuous delivery for machine learning (CD4ML)</strong> apply continuous delivery practices to developing machine learning models so that they are always ready for production. This technique addresses two main problems of traditional machine learning model development: long cycle time between training models and deploying them to production, which often includes manually converting the model to production-ready code; and using production models that had been trained with stale data.</p><br><br><p>A continuous delivery pipeline of a machine learning model has two triggers: (1) changes to the structure of the model and (2) changes to the training and test data sets. For this to work we need to both version <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/versioning-data-for-reproducible-analytics"">the data sets</a> and the model's source code. The pipeline often includes steps such as testing the model against the test data set, applying automatic conversion of the model (if necessary) with tools such as <a href=""https://www.h2o.ai/"">H2O</a>, and deploying the model to production to deliver value.</p>"
Crypto shredding,trial,techniques,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"<p>Maintaining proper control over sensitive data is difficult, especially when it's copied outside of a master system of record for backup and recovery purposes. <strong>Crypto shredding</strong> is the practice of rendering sensitive data unreadable by deliberately overwriting or deleting encryption keys used to secure that data. Considering there are systems, such as audit application or blockchain, that should not or could not delete historical records, this technique is quite useful for privacy protection and <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/gdpr-it-s-time-rethink-your-approach-privacy"">GDPR</a> compliance.</p>"
Infrastructure configuration scanner,trial,techniques,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,"<p>For some time now we've recommended that delivery teams take ownership of their entire stack, including infrastructure. This means increased responsibility in the delivery team itself for configuring the infrastructure in a safe, secure and compliant way. When adopting cloud strategies, most organizations default to a tightly locked-down and centrally managed configuration to reduce risk, but this also creates substantial productivity bottlenecks. An alternative approach is to allow teams to manage their own configuration and use an <strong>infrastructure configuration scanner</strong> to ensure the configuration is safe and secure. Options include open-source scanners such as <a href=""https://github.com/toniblyx/prowler"">prowler</a> for <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/aws"">AWS</a> and <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/tools/kube-bench"">kube-bench</a> for <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/kubernetes"">Kubernetes</a> installations. For more continuous detection, take a look at cloud platforms such as AWS Config Rules among other commercial services.</p>"
Service mesh,trial,techniques,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,"<p><strong>Service mesh</strong> is an approach to operating a secure, fast and reliable microservices ecosystem. It has been an important stepping stone in making it easier to adopt microservices at scale. It offers discovery, security, tracing, monitoring and failure handling. It provides these cross-functional capabilities without the need for a shared asset such as an API gateway or baking libraries into each service. A typical implementation involves lightweight reverse-proxy processes, aka sidecars, deployed alongside each service process in a separate container. Sidecars intercept the inbound and outbound traffic of each service and provide cross-functional capabilities mentioned above. This approach has relieved the distributed service teams from building and updating the capabilities that the mesh offers as code in their services. This has lead to an even easier adoption of <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/polyglot-programming"">polyglot programming</a> in a microservices ecosystem. Our teams have been successfully using this approach with open source projects such as <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/istio"">Istio</a> and we will continue to monitor other open service mesh implementations such as <a href=""http://linkerd.io/"">Linkerd</a> closely.</p>"
Ethical OS,assess,techniques,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"<p>As developers at ThoughtWorks we're acutely aware of the ethics of the work we do. As society becomes ever more reliant on technology, it's important that we consider ethics when making decisions as software development teams. Several toolkits have emerged that can help us think through some of the future implications of the software we're building. They include <a href=""http://tarotcardsoftech.artefactgroup.com/"">Tarot Cards of Tech</a> and <strong><a href=""https://ethicalos.org/"">Ethical OS</a></strong>, which we've had good feedback on. Ethical OS is a thinking framework and a set of tools that drive discussions around the ethics of building software. The framework is a collaboration between the Institute for the Future and the Tech and Society Solutions Lab. It's based on a practical set of risk zones, such as addiction and the <a href=""https://eand.co/the-dopamine-economy-336b239272ef"">dopamine economy</a>, plus a number of scenarios to drive conversation and discussion.</p>"
Smart contracts,assess,techniques,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"<p>The more experience we gain with using distributed ledger technologies (DLTs), the more we encounter the rough edges around the current state of <strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract"">smart contracts</a></strong>. Committing automated, irrefutable, irreversible contracts on ledger sounds great in theory. The problems arise when you consider how to use modern software delivery techniques to developing them, as well as the differences between implementations. Immutable data is one thing, but immutable business logic is something else entirely! It's really important to think about whether to include logic in a smart contract. We've also found very different operational characteristics between different implementations. For example, even though contracts can evolve, different platforms support this evolution to a greater or lesser extent. Our advice is to think long and hard before committing business logic to a smart contract and to weigh the merits of the different platforms before you do.</p>"
Transfer learning for NLP,assess,techniques,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"<p>Transfer learning has been quite effective within the field of computer vision, speeding the time to train a model by reusing existing models. Those of us who work in machine learning are excited that the same techniques can be applied to natural language processing (NLP) with the publication of <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146"">ULMFiT</a> and open source pretrained models and code examples. We think <strong>transfer learning for NLP</strong> will significantly reduce the effort to create systems dealing with text classification.</p>"
Wardley mapping,assess,techniques,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"<p>We're usually wary of covering diagrammatic techniques, but <strong><a href=""https://medium.com/wardleymaps"">Wardley mapping</a></strong> is an interesting approach to start conversations around the evolution of an organization's software estate. At their simplest, they're used to visualize the value chains that exist within an organization, starting with customers' needs and progressively plotting the different capabilities and systems used to deliver on those needs along with the evolution of those capabilities and systems. The value of this technique is the process of collaborating to create the maps rather than the artefact itself. We recommend getting the right people in the room to produce them, and then treat them as living, evolving things rather than a complete artefact.</p>"
Productionizing notebooks,hold,techniques,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"<p><a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/tools/jupyter"">Jupyter Notebooks</a> have gained in popularity among data scientists who use them for exploratory analyses, early-stage development and knowledge sharing. This rise in popularity has led to the trend of <strong>productionizing Jupyter Notebooks</strong>, by providing the tools and support to execute them at scale. Although we wouldn't want to discourage anyone from using their tools of choice, we don't recommend using Jupyter Notebooks for building scalable, maintainable and long-lived production code — they lack effective version control, error handling, modularity and extensibility among other basic capabilities required for building scalable, production-ready code. Instead, we encourage developers and data scientists to work together to find solutions that empower data scientists to build production-ready machine learning models using <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/continuous-delivery-for-machine-learning-cd4ml-models"">continuous delivery</a> practices with the right programming frameworks. We caution against productionization of Jupyter Notebooks to overcome inefficiencies in continuous delivery pipelines for machine learning, or inadequate automated testing.</p>"
Puncturing encapsulation with change data capture,hold,techniques,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_data_capture"">Change data capture</a> (CDC) is a very powerful technique for pulling database changes out of a system and performing some actions on that data. One of the most popular ways of doing this is to use the database's transaction log to identify changes and then publish those changes directly onto an event bus that can be consumed by other services. This works very well for use cases such as <a href=""https://martinfowler.com/articles/break-monolith-into-microservices.html"">breaking monoliths into microservices</a> but when used for first-class integration between microservices, this leads to puncturing encapsulation and leaking the source service's data layer into the event contract. We've talked about <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/domain-scoped-events"">domain scoped events</a> and other techniques that emphasize the importance of having our events model our domain properly. We're seeing some projects use CDC for publishing row-level change events and directly consuming these events in other services. This <strong>puncturing of encapsulation with change data capture</strong> can be a slippery slope leading to fragile integrations and we would like to call this out with this blip.</p>"
Release train,hold,techniques,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"<p>We've seen organizations successfully move from very infrequent releases to a higher cadence by using the <strong>release train</strong> concept. The release train is a technique for coordinating releases across multiple teams or components that have runtime dependencies. All releases happen on a fixed and reliable schedule regardless of whether all expected features are ready (the train doesn't wait for you — if you miss it you wait for the next one). Although we wholeheartedly endorse discipline around regularly releasing and demoing working software, we've experienced serious drawbacks with the approach over the medium to long term as it reinforces temporal coupling around sequencing of changes and can degrade quality as teams rush to complete features. We prefer to focus on the architectural and organizational approaches necessary to support independent releases. Although the train can be a useful forcing function for speeding up slower teams, we've also seen it as imposing an upper limit on how quickly faster-moving teams can move. We believe that it is a technique that should be approached with a good degree of caution, if at all.</p>"
Templating in YAML,hold,techniques,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"<p>As infrastructures grow in complexity, so do the configuration files that define them. Tools such as <a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/"">AWS CloudFormation</a>, <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/kubernetes"">Kubernetes</a> and <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/tools/helm"">Helm</a> expect configuration files in JSON or YAML syntax, presumably in an attempt to make them easy to write and process. However, in most cases, teams quickly reach the point where they have some parts that are similar but not quite the same, for example, when the same service must be deployed in different regions with a slightly different setup. For such cases tools offer <strong>templating in YAML</strong> (or JSON), which has caused a huge amount of <a href=""https://leebriggs.co.uk/blog/2019/02/07/why-are-we-templating-yaml.html"">frustration with practitioners</a>. The problem is that the syntax of JSON and YAML requires all sorts of awkward compromises to graft templating features such as conditionals and loops into the files. We recommend using an API from a programming language instead or, when this is not an option, a templating system in a programming language, either a general-purpose language such as Python or something specialized such as <a href=""https://jsonnet.org/"">Jsonnet</a>.</p>"
Contentful,adopt,platforms,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,"<p>Headless content management systems (CMSes) are becoming a common component of digital platforms. <a href=""http://www.contentful.com/""><strong>Contentful</strong></a> is a modern headless CMS that our teams have successfully integrated into their development workflows. We particularly like its API-first approach and implementation of <a href=""http://www.contentful.com/r/knowledgebase/cms-as-code/"">CMS as code</a>. It supports powerful content modeling primitives as code and content model evolution scripts, which allow it to be treated like other data store schemas and enable <a href=""http://martinfowler.com/articles/evodb.html"">evolutionary database design</a> practices to be applied to CMS development. Its robustness and a stream of new features, including a sandbox environment, have impressed our teams further and made Contentful our default choice in this space.</p>"
AWS Fargate,trial,platforms,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,"<p><strong><a href=""http://aws.amazon.com/fargate/"">AWS Fargate</a></strong>, the docker-as-a-service option on <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/aws"">AWS</a>, is now widely available across regions. It's a great solution for situations in which teams want to run Docker containers, because <a>AWS Lambda</a> functions aren't powerful enough, without having to manage EC2 instances or Kubernetes clusters. Our teams report generally positive experiences with Fargate; however, the convenience of this managed service can come at a cost, in financial terms.</p>"
EVM beyond Ethereum,trial,platforms,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"<p><a href=""https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Virtual-Machine-(EVM)-Awesome-List"">Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)</a> was originally designed for the <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/ethereum"">Ethereum</a> main network. Nowadays, however, most teams no longer want to reinvent blockchain from scratch; instead, they'd like to take <strong>EVM beyond Ethereum</strong>. We've seen a lot of blockchain teams choose to fork Ethereum (e.g., <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/quorum"">Quorum</a>) or implement the EVM spec (e.g., <a href=""https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow"">Burrow</a>, <a href=""https://github.com/PegaSysEng/pantheon"">Pantheon</a>), adding their own designs. The intention is to not only reuse the Ethereum design but also leverage its ecosystem and developer community. To many developers, the concept of ""smart contract"" is almost equivalent to a smart contract written in <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks/solidity"">Solidity</a>. Although Ethereum itself has some constraints, the technology around the EVM ecosystem is booming.</p>"
InfluxDB,trial,platforms,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"<p><a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/time-series-databases"">Time series databases</a> (TSDBs) have been around for some time now. But increasingly they're becoming more mainstream as more use cases naturally fit the time series model. <a href=""https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb""><strong>InfluxDB</strong></a> continues to remain a good choice for TSDBs with monitoring being one of its key use cases. <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/tick-stack"">TICK Stack</a> is an example of a monitoring solution that has InfluxDB at its heart. Influx 2.0 alpha recently introduced Flux — a scripting language for querying and processing time series data. It's still early days for Flux and the jury's out on its <a href=""https://medium.com/timescale/sql-vs-flux-influxdb-query-language-time-series-database-290977a01a8a"">broader adoption beyond InfluxDB</a>, but it promises to be more powerful and expressive than InfluxQL and enables pushing time series analytic workloads to the database. However, clustering support for InfluxDB is only available with the enterprise version which has limited its adoption on some of our projects.</p>"
Istio,trial,platforms,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,"<p><strong><a href=""https://istio.io/"">Istio</a></strong> is becoming the de facto infrastructure to operationalize a <a href=""https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html"">microservices</a> ecosystem. Its out-of-the-box implementation of cross-cutting concerns — such as service discovery, service-to-service and origin-to-service security, observability (including telemetry and distributed tracing), rolling releases and resiliency — has been bootstrapping our microservices implementations very quickly. It's the main implementation of the <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/service-mesh"">service mesh</a> technique we've been using. We've been enjoying its monthly releases and its continuous improvements with seamless upgrades. We use Istio to bootstrap our projects, starting with observability (tracing and telemetry) and service-to-service security. We're closely watching its improvements to service-to-service authentication everywhere in and outside of the mesh. We'd also like to see Istio establish best practices for configuration files to strike a balance between giving autonomy to service developers and control to the service mesh operators.</p>"
Kafka Streams,trial,platforms,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,"<p><strong><a href=""https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/"">Kafka Streams</a></strong> is a lightweight library to build streaming applications. It supports basic streaming APIs such as join, filter, map and aggregate as well as local storage for common use cases such as windowing and sessions. Unlike other stream-processing platforms such as <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/apache-spark"">Apache Spark</a> and <a href=""https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-stream-kafka/current/home.html"">Alpakka Kafka</a>, Kafka Streams has been a good fit for scenarios that don't require large-scale distribution and parallel processing; hence we could get away without yet another piece of infrastructure such as cluster schedulers. Naturally, Kafka Streams has been a good choice when operating in the Kafka ecosystem. Kafka Streams is particularly useful when we have to process data strictly in order and exactly once. One particular use case of Kafka Streams is to build a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_data_capture#Event_Programming"">change data capture (CDC)</a> platform.</p>"
Nomad,trial,platforms,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,"<p>HashiCorp continues to release interesting software. We've featured <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/tools/hashicorp-vault"">HashiCorp Vault</a> in March 2017, and tools related to Terraform are all over this edition of the Radar. We've moved <strong><a href=""https://www.nomadproject.io/"">Nomad</a></strong> to Trial because we've had positive experiences using it. While <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/kubernetes"">Kubernetes</a> continues to gain traction, we like Nomad's general applicability. It's not just limited to running containerized workloads but can be used to schedule just about anything. Java and Golang are supported natively as well as batch and distributed cron jobs. We like its focus on multi- and hybrid-cloud operations, something likely to become more important to avoid sticky clouds and the fact that it does scheduling well.</p>"

CloudEvents,assess,platforms,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"<p>Outside the function code itself, applications written as serverless functions are tightly coupled to the cloud platform on which they're hosted. Although events are a common FaaS-triggering mechanism, and every cloud provider supports them in some form, the current proprietary specifications prevent interoperability across clouds. The <strong><a href=""https://cloudevents.io/"">CloudEvents</a></strong> specification is a burgeoning standard that has been accepted into the <a href=""https://www.cncf.io/sandbox-projects/"">CNCF Sandbox</a>.

Cloudflare Workers,assess,platforms,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"<p>Most modern server-side or serverless code execution platforms are centered around containers or VMs. <strong><a href=""https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-workers/"">Cloudflare Workers</a></strong>, however, takes a different approach to hosting a serverless computing offering. It uses <a href=""https://v8docs.nodesource.com/node-0.8/d5/dda/classv8_1_1_isolate.html"">V8 Isolates</a>, the open source JavaScript engine developed for Chrome, to run functions as a service (FaaS) on their extensive CDN network. Code can be written in JavaScript or anything that compiles to <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks/webassembly"">WebAssembly</a> and data can be accessed from Cloudflare's cache or key-value store. The major benefit for developers is performance: by being on the edge network, close to end users, cold-starts take only five milliseconds. For the provider the benefits include both the ability to densely pack isolates because of their lower memory overhead and faster performance through reduced process context switching. This is definitely an intriguing approach to monitor and assess.</p>"
Deno,assess,platforms,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"<p>As a group we have mixed feelings about programming in JavaScript on the server side, especially when the rationale for doing so is simply to avoid <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/polyglot-programming"">polyglot programming</a>. That said, if you decide to use JavaScript or TypeScript on the server, have a look at <strong><a href=""https://deno.land/"">Deno</a></strong>.

Although there are plenty of ways to misuse this approach, it's worth assessing whether to add it to your toolkit.</p>"
Knative,assess,platforms,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"<p>The <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/serverless-architecture"">serverless architecture</a> has popularized a FaaS style of programming among developers; it helps developers focus on solving core business problems with independently built and deployed functions that react to an event, run a business process, produce other events in the process and scale down to zero. Historically, proprietary serverless platforms such as <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/aws-lambda"">AWS Lambda</a> or Microsoft <a href=""https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/"">Azure Functions</a> have enabled this programming paradigm. <strong><a href=""https://www.knative.dev/"">Knative</a></strong> is an open-source Kubernetes-based platform to run FaaS workloads. There are few things that stand out about Knative: it's open source and provider agnostic; it implements the serverless workflow as described in the CNCF Serverless Working Group <a href=""https://github.com/cncf/wg-serverless/tree/master/whitepapers/serverless-overview"">whitepaper</a>; it ensures cross-service interoperability by implementing its eventing interface consistent with <a href=""https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/master/spec.md#design-goals"">CNCF CloudEvents</a> specification; and, most importantly, it addresses a common challenge of operating a harmonized and yet hybrid FaaS and long-running container-based architecture. It easily integrates with both <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/istio"">Istio</a> and <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/kubernetes"">Kubernetes</a>. For example, developers can take advantage of roll-out strategies that Istio implements by traffic splitting between different revisions of the functions.

Some challenges result from <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/smart-contracts"">complex smart contract programming</a> and some come from Quorum itself. For example, it doesn't work well with load balancers and only has partial database support, which will lead to significant deployment burden. We faced some stability and compatibility issues especially on private transactions. Quorum recently attracted a lot of attention because of <a href=""https://www.jpmorgan.com/global/news/digital-coin-payments"">JPM Coin</a>.

The configuration of the servers instantiated by Terraform is usually left to Puppet, Chef or Ansible. We like Terraform because the syntax of its files is quite readable and because it supports a number of cloud providers while making no attempt to provide an artificial abstraction across those providers. The active community will add support for the latest features from most cloud providers. Following our first, more cautious, mention of Terraform almost two years ago, it has seen continued development and has evolved into a stable product with a good ecosystem that has proven its value in our projects. The issue with state file management can now be sidestepped by using what Terraform calls a ""remote state backend.""

AVA,trial,tools,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"<p><strong><a href=""https://github.com/avajs/ava"">AVA</a></strong> is a test runner for Node.js. Even though JavaScript is single-threaded, IO in Node.js can happen in parallel because of its asynchronous nature. AVA takes advantage of this and runs your tests concurrently, which is especially beneficial for IO-heavy tests. In addition, test files are run in parallel as separate processes, giving you even better performance and an isolated environment for each test file. AVA is a lightweight option, when compared to full-featured frameworks such as <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks/jest"">Jest</a>.

Helm has two components: a command line utility called Helm and a cluster component called Tiller. Securing a Kubernetes cluster is a wide and nuanced topic, but we highly recommend setting up Tiller in a role-based access control (RBAC) environment. We've used Helm in a number of client projects and its dependency management, templating and hook mechanism has greatly simplified the application lifecycle management in Kubernetes. However, we recommend proceeding with caution — Helm's <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/templating-in-yaml"">YAML templating</a> can be difficult to understand, and Tiller still has some rough edges.

Handwritten CloudFormation,hold,tools,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"<p><a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/"">AWS CloudFormation</a> is a proprietary declarative language to provision AWS infrastructure as code. Handwriting CloudFormation files is often a default approach to bootstrap AWS infrastructure automation. Although this might be a sensible way to start a small project, our teams, and the industry at large, have found that <strong>handwritten CloudFormation</strong> simply does not scale as the infrastructure grows. Noticeable pitfalls of handwritten CloudFormation files for large projects include poor readability, lack of imperative constructs, limited parameter definition and usage, and lack of type checking. Addressing these shortfalls has led to a rich ecosystem of both open-source and custom tooling. We find <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/tools/terraform"">Terraform</a> a sensible default that not only addresses shortfalls of CloudFormation but also has an active community to add the latest AWS features and fix bugs. In addition to Terraform, you can choose from many other tools and languages, including <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks/troposphere"">troposphere</a>, <a href=""https://github.com/cloudreach/sceptre"">sceptre</a>, <a href=""https://github.com/capitalone/stack-deployment-tool"">Stack Deployment Tool</a> and <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/pulumi"">Pulumi</a>.</p>"

Apache Beam,trial,languages-and-frameworks,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,"<p><strong><a href=""https://beam.apache.org/"">Apache Beam</a></strong> is an open-source unified programming model for defining and executing both batch and streaming data parallel processing pipelines. The Beam model is based on the <a href=""http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol8/p1792-Akidau.pdf"">Dataflow model</a> which allows us to express logic in an elegant way so that we can easily switch between batch, windowed batch or streaming. The big data-processing ecosystem has been evolving quite a lot which can make it difficult to choose the right data-processing engine. One of the key reasons to choose Beam is that it allows us to switch between different runners — a few months ago <a href=""http://samza.apache.org/"">Apache Samza</a> was added to the other runners it already supports, which include <a href=""https://spark.apache.org/"">Apache Spark</a>, <a href=""https://flink.apache.org/"">Apache Flink</a> and <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/google-cloud-dataflow"">Google Cloud Dataflow</a>. Different runners have different capabilities and providing a portable API is a difficult task.
