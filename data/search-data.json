Second, if the JavaScript doesn’t behave exactly as you want you will have to hack the generated code.

Google App Engine, Amazon EC2 and Salesforce.com all claim to be Cloud providers, yet each of their offerings differ. The Cloud fits into a broad categorization of service offerings split out into Infrastructure as a Service (e.g. Amazon EC2 and Rackspace), Platform as a Service (e.g. App Engine) and Software as a Service (e.g. Salesforce.com). In some cases, providers may span multiple service categories, further diluting the Cloud as a label.

Two characteristics of functional languages in particular are driving this interest, immutability with its implications for parallelism and functions as first class objects. While the introduction of closures to C# brings some of the latter capability, functional languages are almost synonymous with immutability. The placement of these languages within the assess ring indicates our view of their relative maturity and appropriateness. F#, based on OCaml, is fully supported within the Visual Studio toolset. F# includes support for objects and imperative constructs in addition to functional language constructs in a natural way. Scala, like F#, combines the object and functional paradigms, although the syntax of Scala is more Java-like. Clojure began as a JVM language and is now available on the .NET CLR. Clojure does allow for mutable state although it has an extensive set of immutable persistent data structures, all supporting multi-threaded applications. There are many similarities between these three languages, but at the moment we believe F# and Clojure to be better suited to most organizations for assessing than Scala.

Moving to an often terse syntax for solving complex problems may initially be intimidating to many. As with all forms of programming languages, syntax is just one aspect of the language itself. In functional programming another significant aspect is the use of common idioms. These idioms speed code comprehension and increase overall maintainability. This might not be news to all, but it is worth noting that dynamic languages are long ready for adoption and trial. Ruby, particularly when deployed on JRuby, is ready for adoption. Thoughtworks uses Ruby and JRuby extensively in both its Services and Product work. Groovy is ready for trial and could prove more accessible than Ruby/JRuby in a Java shop.

Capabilities describe an organization’s operating model in terms of goals and competencies (what is to be done), rather than implementation specifics (how things are done). Whereas business architecture models based on people, process or technology are contingent, volatile and often short lived, and therefore ill-suited to the long-term planning needs of the organization, capability models provide a description of the business context that is stable enough to serve as a basis for identifying and prioritising technology and process initiatives.",

The key challenge is the different ways to install the driver and start the browser, but this only needs to be solved once. We suggest that companies doing mobile web for these devices try this approach. We see no reason why this approach cannot be extended to Windows Phone in the future.",

An alternative architecture is starting to emerge in implementations like Node.js (a JavaScript server running on Google V8), Nginx (an open source web server and proxy), and Webbit (a Java application server), that uses a single thread to serve many connections, processing all I/O asynchronously.

In the cloud, many systems scale automatically, either to provide additional availability or in response to increased demand. Crucial to managing a growing estate, immutable servers, or ‘phoenix servers’, are a sensible approach for enterprises looking at IaaS and PaaS. In contrast, custom-configured ‘snowflake servers’ increase the load on the operations group and encourage a “works on my machine” mentality. Being able to re-provision machines - hard or virtual - from scratch using tools such as Chef or Puppet can drastically reduce the complexity of managing large server farms. Coupled with software that is designed to withstand failure, this will lead to more scalable and reliable systems.",

In much the same way that DevOps has recast how historically adversarial groups can work together, the same is happening for security and development professionals.

There is little support for testing and a real danger to get into <em>event hell</em>. We do like that it uses functional mixins for behavior, like composition instead of inheritance.</p>",

With Kylin you can define cubes using a Cube Designer and initiate an offline process that builds these cubes. The offline process performs a pre-join step to join facts and dimension tables into a flattened out structure. This is followed by a pre-aggregation phase where individual cuboids are built using Map Reduce jobs. The results are stored in HDFS sequence files and are later loaded into HBase. The data requests can originate from SQL submitted using a SQL-based tool. The query engine (based on <strong>Apache Calcite</strong> ), determines if the target dataset exists in HBase. If so, the engine directly accesses the target data from HBase and returns the result with sub-second latency. If not, the engine routes the queries to <strong>Hive</strong> (or any other SQL on Hadoop solution enabled on the cluster).</p>",

Distributed map-reduce algorithms are a handy technique for large data sets, but many data sets we see could easily fit in a single-node relational or graph database. Even if you do have more data than that, usually the best thing to do is to first pick out the data you need, which can often then be processed on such a single node. So we urge that before you spin up your clusters, take a realistic assessment of what you need to process, and if it fits—maybe in RAM—use the simple option.</p>",

Critics accuse REST of causing chatty, inefficient interactions among systems and failing to adapt as client needs evolve.

But in our experience, it isn’t REST that causes these problems. Rather, they stem from a failure to properly model the domain as a set of resources. Naively developing services that simply expose static, hierarchical data models via templated URLs result in an <strong>anemic REST</strong> implementation. In a richly modeled domain, REST should enable more than simple repetitive data fetching. In a fully evolved RESTful architecture, business events and abstract concepts are also modeled as resources, and the implementation should make effective use of hypertext, link relations and media types to maximize decoupling between services.

In a richly modeled domain, REST should enable more than simple repetitive data fetching. In a fully evolved RESTful architecture, business events and abstract concepts are also modeled as resources, and the implementation should make effective use of hypertext, link relations and media types to maximize decoupling between services.

We find that these platforms are most effective when they're given the same respect as an external product offering. <strong>Applying product management to internal platforms</strong> means establishing empathy with internal consumers (read: developers) and collaborating with them on the design. Platform product managers establish roadmaps and ensure the platform delivers value to the business and enhances the developer experience. Some owners even create a brand identity for the internal platform and use that to market the benefits to their colleagues. Platform product managers look after the quality of the platform, gather usage metrics, and continuously improve it over time.

Although we caution against extending and actively maintaining legacy monoliths, they continue to be dependencies in our environments, and developers often underestimate the cost and time required to develop against these dependencies. To help reduce the friction, developers have used virtualized <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/machine-image-as-a-build-artifact\">machine images</a> or container images with <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/docker\">Docker</a> containers to create immutable images of legacy systems and their configurations. The intent is to contain the <strong>legacy in a box</strong> for developers to run locally and remove the need for rebuilding, reconfiguring or sharing environments. In an ideal scenario, teams that own legacy systems generate the corresponding boxed legacy images through their build pipelines, and developers can then run and orchestrate these images in their allocated sandbox more reliably. Although this approach has reduced the overall time spent by each developer, it has had limited success when the teams owning the downstream dependencies have been reluctant to create container images for others to use.</p>",

To work together efficiently, even autonomous microservices need to align with some organizational standards. A <strong>service mesh</strong> offers consistent discovery, security, tracing, monitoring and failure handling without the need for a shared asset such as an API gateway or ESB. A typical implementation involves lightweight reverse-proxy processes deployed alongside each service process, perhaps in a separate container.

Service interoperability and observability are gained through a shared implementation of this proxy but not a shared runtime instance.

Each metric creates a virtuous cycle and focuses the teams on continuous improvement: to reduce lead time, you reduce wasteful activities which, in turn, lets you deploy more frequently; deployment frequency forces your teams to improve their practices and automation; your speed to recover from failure is improved by better practices, automation and monitoring which reduces the frequency of failures.</p>",

Traditionally, configuration of monitoring dashboards and setting up alerts is done through GUI-based point-and-click systems.

We see a new <strong>risk-commensurate vendor strategy</strong> emerging that encourages investment to maintain vendor independence for highly critical business systems. Less critical business functions can take advantage of the streamlined delivery of a vendor-native solution because it allows them to absorb more easily the impact of losing that vendor.

In this Radar, we're excited about addressing the security and size of containers with a new technique called <strong>distroless docker images</strong> , pioneered by Google. With this technique, the footprint of the image is reduced to the application, its resources and language runtime dependencies, without operating system distribution. The advantages of this technique include reduced noise of security scanners, smaller security attack surface, reduced overhead of patching vulnerabilities and even smaller image size for higher performance.

To work together efficiently, even autonomous microservices need to align with some organizational standards. A <strong>service mesh</strong> offers consistent discovery, security, tracing, monitoring and failure handling without the need for a shared asset such as an API gateway or ESB. A typical implementation involves lightweight reverse-proxy processes deployed alongside each service process, perhaps in a separate container. These proxies communicate with service registries, identity providers, log aggregators and other services. Service interoperability and observability are gained through a shared implementation of this proxy but not a shared runtime instance.

This leaves consumers in a difficult place when choosing and committing to a provider. Increasingly, we're seeing organizations prepare to use \"any cloud\" and to avoid vendor lock-in at all costs. This, of course, leads to <strong>generic cloud usage</strong>. We see organizations limiting their use of the cloud to only those features common across all cloud providers—thereby missing out on the providers' unique benefits. We see organizations making large investments in home-grown abstraction layers that are too complex to build and too costly to maintain to stay cloud agnostic. The problem of lock-in is real. We recommend approaching this problem with a multicloud strategy that evaluates the migration cost and effort of capabilities from one cloud to another, against the benefits of using cloud-specific features. We recommend increasing the portability of the workloads by shipping the applications as widely adopted <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/docker\">Docker</a> containers: use open source security and identity protocols to easily migrate the identity of the workloads, a <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/risk-commensurate-vendor-strategy\">risk-commensurate vendor strategy</a> to maintain cloud independence only where necessary and <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/polycloud\">Polycloud</a> to mix and match services from different providers where it makes sense.

One antipattern we keep seeing is <strong>legacy migration feature parity</strong>, the desire to retain feature parity with the old. We see this as a huge missed opportunity. Often the old systems have bloated over time, with many features unused by users (50% according to a <a href=\"https://www.standishgroup.com/sample_research_files/Exceeding%20Value_Layout.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"2014 Standish Group report.

Since expert humans that can accurately label data are a scarce resource and labeling is often the most time-consuming activity in the machine-learning workflow, semi-supervised techniques lower the cost of training and make machine learning feasible for a new class of users. We're also seeing the application of weakly supervised techniques where machine-labeled data is used but is trusted less than the data labeled by humans.</p>",

This fails to realize the cloud's promises of agility and digital innovation. A cloud migration requires intentional change across multiple axes toward a cloud-native state, and depending on the unique migration circumstances, each organization might end up somewhere on the spectrum from cloud lift and shift to cloud native. Systems architecture, for example, is one of the pillars of delivery agility and often requires change.

The key improvement over other solutions is that Snowpack makes it possible to build applications with modern frameworks such as <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks/react-js\">React.js</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks/vue-js\">Vue.js</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks/angular\">Angular</a> without the need for a bundler. Cutting out the bundling step dramatically improves the feedback cycle during development because changes become available in the browser almost immediately. For this magic to work, Snowpack transforms the dependencies in <code>node_modules</code> into single JavaScript files in a new <code>web_modules</code> directory, from where they can be imported as an ECMAScript module (ESM). For IE11 and other browsers that don't support ESM, a workaround is available.

Although the principles are intuitive and attempt to address many of the known challenges of previous centralized analytical data management, they transcend the available analytical data technologies.

Secondly, we often hear teams cite performance as a reason to choose Node.js. Although there are myriads of more or less sensible benchmarks, this perception is rooted in history. When Node.js became popular, it was the first major framework to embrace a nonblocking programming model which made it very efficient for IO-heavy tasks. (We mentioned this in our write-up of Node.js in 2012.) Due to its single-threaded nature, Node.js was never a good choice for compute-heavy workloads, though, and now that capable nonblocking frameworks also exist on other platforms — some with elegant, modern APIs — performance is no longer a reason to choose Node.js.</p>",

Sometimes, technical issues need our attention such as improving performance or reliability. One common approach to address these issues is to create \"technical stories\" using the same format as a user story but with a technical outcome rather than a business one. But these technical tasks are often difficult to estimate, take longer than anticipated or don't end up having the desired outcome. An alternative, more successful method is to apply <strong>hypothesis-driven legacy renovation</strong>. Rather than working toward a standard backlog, the team takes ownership of a measurable technical outcome and collectively establishes a set of hypotheses about the problem. They then conduct iterative, time-boxed experiments to verify or disprove each hypothesis in order of priority. The resulting workflow is optimized for reducing uncertainty rather than following a plan toward a predictable outcome.</p>",

That sort of \"outside-in\" approach works well for a number of legacy systems, but now that we've had enough experience with single-page applications (SPA) for them to become legacy systems themselves, we're seeing the opposite \"inside-out\" approach used to replace them. Instead of wrapping the legacy system, we instead embed the beginning of the new SPA into the HTML document containing the old one and let it slowly expand in functionality. The SPA frameworks don't even need to be the same as long as users can tolerate the performance hit of the increased page size (e.g., embedding a new <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks/react-js\">React</a> app inside an old <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks/angularjs\">AngularJS</a> one). <strong>SPA injection</strong> allows you to iteratively remove the old SPA until the new one completely takes over. Whereas a strangler fig can be viewed as a type of parasite that uses the host tree's stable external surface to support itself until it takes root and the host itself dies, this approach is more like injecting an outside agent into the host, relying on functionality of the original SPA until it can completely take over.</p>",

In this technique, a single set of type definitions is used to define both the data objects returned by front-end queries and the data served to satisfy those queries by the back-end server. Ordinarily, we would be cautious about this practice because of the unnecessarily tight coupling it creates across process boundaries. However, many teams are finding that the benefits of this approach outweigh any risks of tight coupling. Since the BFF pattern works best when the same team owns both the UI code and the BFF, often storing both components in the same repository, the UI/BFF pair can be viewed as a single cohesive system. When the BFF offers strongly typed queries, the results can be tailored to the specific needs of the frontend rather than reusing a single, general-purpose entity that must serve the needs of many consumers and contain more fields than actually required. This reduces the risk of accidentally exposing data that the user shouldn't see, prevents incorrect interpretation of the returned data object and makes the query more expressive. This practice is particularly useful when implemented with <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks/io-ts\">io-ts</a> to enforce the run-time type safety.</p>",

An enthusiastic community has emerged around this feature and that means a wide range of user-contributed tools and workflows are available to get started. Tools vendors are also getting on board via the <a href=\"https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"GitHub Marketplace. This is an external link. Opens in new tab\" class=\"pop-out\">GitHub Marketplace<span class=\"pop-out-icon\"></span></a>. However, we still recommend you proceed with caution. Although code and <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/tools/git\">Git</a> history can be exported into alternative hosts, a development workflow based on GitHub Actions can't. Also, use your best judgment to determine when a project is large or complex enough to warrant an independently supported pipeline tool. But for getting up and running quickly on smaller projects, it's worth considering GitHub Actions and the ecosystem that is growing around them.</p>",

    "descriptionHtml": "<p>As more businesses turn to events as a way to share data among microservices, collect analytics or feed data lakes, <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/tools/apache-kafka\">Apache Kafka</a> has become a favorite platform to support an event-driven architectural style. Although Kafka was a revolutionary concept in scalable persistent messaging, a lot of moving parts are required to make it work, including ZooKeeper, brokers, partitions, and mirrors. While these can be particularly tricky to implement and operate, they do offer great flexibility and power when needed, especially at an industrial enterprise scale. Because of the high barrier to entry presented by the full Kafka ecosystem, we welcome the recent explosion of platforms offering the <strong>Kafka API without Kafka</strong>. Recent entries such as <a href=\"https://github.com/streamnative/kop\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"Kafka on Pulsar. This is an external link. Opens in new tab\" class=\"pop-out\">Kafka on Pulsar<span class=\"pop-out-icon\"></span></a> and <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/redpanda\">Redpanda</a> offer alternative architectures, and <a href=\"https://github.com/Azure/azure-event-hubs-for-kafka\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"Azure Event Hubs for Kafka.

It remains to be seen, however, if developers actually adopt this strategy or if it is merely an attempt by competitors to lure users away from the Kafka platform. Ultimately, perhaps Kafka's most enduring impact could be the convenient protocol and API provided to clients.</p>",

At first glance, you would be forgiven for asking why the world needs another message queueing system. Message queues have been around in various forms for nearly as long as businesses have been using computers and have undergone years of refinement and optimization for various tasks. But NATS has several interesting characteristics and is unique in its ability to scale from embedded controllers to global, cloud-hosted superclusters. We're particularly intrigued by NATS's intent to support a continuous streaming flow of data from mobile devices and IoT and through a network of interconnected systems. However, some tricky issues need to be addressed, not the least of which is ensuring consumers see only the messages and topics to which they're allowed access, especially when the network spans organizational boundaries. NATS 2.0 introduced a security and access control framework that supports multitenant clusters where accounts restrict a user's access to queues and topics. Written in Go, NATS has primarily been embraced by the Go language community. Although clients exist for pretty much all widely used programming languages, the Go client is by far the most popular. However, some of our developers have found that all the language client libraries tend to reflect the Go origins of codebase. Increasing bandwidth and processing power on small, wireless devices means that the volume of data businesses must consume in real time will only increase. Assess NATS as a possible platform for streaming that data within and among businesses.</p>",

In our recent internal work on ThoughtWorks websites, we included the open-source accessibility (a11y) testing engine <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"axe-core.

And we're increasingly seeing misguided measurement approaches with tools that help teams measure these metrics based purely on their continuous delivery (CD) pipelines. In particular when it comes to the stability metrics (MTTR and change fail percentage), CD pipeline data alone doesn't provide enough information to determine what a deployment failure with real user impact is. Stability metrics only make sense if they include data about real incidents that degrade service for the users.</p>\n\n<p>And as with all metrics, we recommend to always keep in mind the ultimate intention behind a measurement and use them to reflect and learn.

Code is usually the only trustworthy source of truth because staff turnover and existing documentation are outdated. Therefore it's very important to reestablish the association between the documentation and the code and spread the business knowledge among the team when we take over a legacy system. In practice, we would first try to go to the codebase and deepen our understanding of the business through simple cleanup and safe refactoring. During the process, we'll need to add annotations to the code so that we're able to automatically generate living documentation later. This is very different from doing BDD in green-field projects, but it's a good start in legacy systems. Based on the generated documentation, we would try to convert some of the specs into executable high-level automation tests. Do this iteratively, and eventually you could get <strong>living documentation in legacy systems</strong> that is closely associated with the code and partially executable.</p>",

This is an external link. Opens in new tab\" class=\"pop-out\">Executive Order on Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity<span class=\"pop-out-icon\"></span></a>. The document puts forward several technical mandates that relate to items we've featured in past Radars, such as <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/zero-trust-architecture\">zero trust architecture</a> and automated compliance scanning using <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/security-policy-as-code\">security policy as code</a>. Much of the document is devoted to improving the security of the software supply chain. One item in particular that caught our attention was the requirement that government software should contain a machine-readable <strong>Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)</strong>, defined as \"a formal record containing the details and supply chain relationships of various components used in building software.\" In other words, it should detail not just the components shipped but also the tools and frameworks used to deliver the software. This order has the potential to usher in a new era of transparency and openness in software development. This will undoubtedly have an impact on those of us who produce software for a living. Many, if not all software products produced today contain open-source components or employ them in the build process. Often, the consumer has no way of knowing which version of which package might have an impact on the security of their product. Instead they must rely on the security alerts and patches provided by the retail vendor. This executive order will ensure that an explicit description of all components is made available to consumers, empowering them to implement their own security controls. And since the SBOM is machine-readable, those controls can be automated. We sense that this move also represents a shift toward embracing open-source software and practically addressing both the security risks and benefits that it provides.</p>",

Firstly, many examples of this have resulted in reputational damage, for example, where an incorrect alert has been sent from a test system to an entire client population. Secondly, the level of security, specifically around protection of private data, tends to be less for test systems. There is little point in having elaborate controls around access to production data if that data is copied to a test database that can be accessed by every developer and QA. Although you <em>can</em> obfuscate the data, this tends to be applied only to specific fields, for example, credit card numbers. Finally, copying production data to test systems can break privacy laws, for example, where test systems are hosted or accessed from a different country or region. This last scenario is especially problematic with complex cloud deployments. Fake data is a safer approach, and tools exist to help in its creation. We do recognize there are reasons for <em>specific</em> elements of production data to be copied, for example, in the reproduction of bugs or for training of specific ML models.

The proxy allows developers to access Kafka through an HTTP interface, which is useful in environments that make using the native Kafka protocol difficult. For example, we were able to consume events emitted through SAP simply by having the SAP team invoke an HTTP POST command through a preconfigured SAP remote function call, avoiding the need to spin up a Java abstraction around SAP (and a team to manage it). The proxy is quite full-featured, although, as with any such adapter tool, we recommend caution and a clear-eyed view of the trade-offs involved. We believe the proxy is valuable when it enables legacy producers to send events, but would be careful creating event consumers through the proxy as the abstraction gets more complex. The proxy doesn't change the fact that Kafka consumers are stateful, which means that consumer instances created through the REST API are tied to a specific proxy, and the need to make an HTTP call to consume messages from a topic changes the standard semantics of Kafka eventing.</p>",

In our last Radar we mentioned <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/kube-managed-cloud-services\">Kube-managed cloud services</a> as a technique, and Crossplane does just that. The idea is to leverage the Kubernetes control plane to provision cloud services on which your deployment is dependent, even if they aren't deployed on the cluster itself. Examples include managed database instances, load balancers or access control policies. This tool is noteworthy for two reasons. First, it demonstrates the powerful and flexible execution environment of the underlying Kubernetes control plane. There is no real limit to the range of supported custom resources. Second, Crossplane provides an alternative to the usual options of <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/tools/terraform\">Terraform</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/aws-cloud-development-kit\">CDK</a> or <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/pulumi\">Pulumi</a>. Crossplane comes with a set of predefined providers for the major cloud services that cover the most commonly provisioned services.

Often associated with the practice of <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/gitops\">GitOps</a>, Crossplane stands on its own and allows you to stay within the Kubernetes ecosystem when it's necessary to manage external cloud resources.

It estimates the causal effect, that is, the magnitude by which an outcome would change, if we changed one of the causal variables. This approach is applied when we can't arrive at the answer through observations and collecting data from A/B testing — due to the cost of experiments or limitations. The DoWhy library estimates the causal effect based on a process that uses the past collected facts and data as well as assumptions one can make knowing the domain. It uses a four-step process of modeling the causal relationships graph based on assumptions, identifying a cause for an outcome, estimating the causal effect and finally challenging those assumptions by refuting the result. We've used this library successfully in production, and it's one of the commonly used libraries in causal estimation use cases.</p>",

Like many UI testing frameworks, it provides an API to locate interface elements, either by specifying a path through the view hierarchy or by using a set of finder methods. These tests are usually simpler than XCUITests, and they run much faster. As a word of caution, though, given the ease with which tests can be written using ViewInspector, you might be tempted to over-test the interface. Testing simple one-to-one mappings is just double-entry bookkeeping. And even though ViewInspector makes it easier to test the SwiftUI code, remember to keep most of the logic in the model.</p>",

We're still observing misguided approaches with tools that help teams measure these metrics based purely on their continuous delivery (CD) pipelines. In particular when it comes to the stability metrics (MTTR and change fail percentage), CD pipeline data alone doesn't provide enough information to determine what a deployment failure with real user impact is. Stability metrics only make sense if they include data about real incidents that degrade service for the users.</p>\n\n<p>We recommend always to keep in mind the ultimate intention behind a measurement and use it to reflect and learn.

Using the <strong>Operator pattern for nonclustered resources</strong> takes advantage of custom resource definitions and the event-driven scheduling mechanism implemented in the Kubernetes control plane to manage activities that are related to yet outside of the cluster. This technique builds on the idea of <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/kube-managed-cloud-services\">Kube-managed cloud services</a> and extends it to other activities, such as continuous deployment or reacting to changes in external repositories. One advantage of this technique over a purpose-built tool is that it opens up a wide range of tools that either come with Kubernetes or are part of the wider ecosystem. You can use commands such as diff, dry-run or apply to interact with the operator's custom resources. Kube's scheduling mechanism makes development easier by eliminating the need to orchestrate activities in the proper order.

Firstly, many examples of this have resulted in reputational damage, for example, where an incorrect alert has been sent from a test system to an entire client population.

There is little point in having elaborate controls around access to production data if that data is copied to a test database that can be accessed by every developer and QA. Although you <em>can</em> obfuscate the data, this tends to be applied only to specific fields, for example, credit card numbers.

Looking at the carbon footprint of building software, for example, we recommend assessing <strong>carbon efficiency as an architectural characteristic</strong>. An architecture that takes into consideration carbon efficiency is one where design and infrastructure choices have been made in order to to minimize energy consumption and therefore carbon emissions. The measurement tooling and advice in this space is maturing, making it feasible for teams to consider carbon efficiency alongside other factors such as performance, scalability, financial cost and security. Like almost everything in software architecture, this should be considered a trade-off; our advice is to think about this as one additional characteristic in a whole set of relevant <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_system_quality_attributes\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"quality attributes.

Server-driven UI separates the rendering into a generic container in the mobile app while the structure and data for each view is provided by the server. This means that changes that once required a round trip to an app store can now be accomplished via simple changes to the responses the server sends. While some very large mobile app teams have had great success with this technique, it also requires a substantial investment in building and maintaining a complex proprietary framework. Such an investment requires a compelling business case. Until the case is made, it might be best to proceed with caution; indeed, we've experienced some horrendous, overly configurable messes that didn't actually deliver on the promised benefits. But with the backing of behemoths such as Airbnb and Lyft, we may very well see some useful frameworks emerge that help tame the complexity. Watch this space.</p>",

Two years and one pandemic later, the demand for cryptographically secure, privacy-respecting and machine-verifiable electronic credentials has grown and, as a result, governments are starting to wake up to VC's potential.

This decentralized approach also enables users to better manage and selectively disclose their own information which greatly improves data privacy protection. For example, powered by zero-knowledge proof technology, you can construct a verifiable credential to prove that you're an adult without revealing your birthday. It’s important to note that although many VC-based <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/decentralized-identity\">decentralized identity</a> solutions rely on blockchain technology, blockchain is not a prerequisite for all VC implementations.</p>",

If an organization sets out to create a collection of small services that can be developed, built, deployed and operated independently but consistently, it makes sense to give teams a solid starting point that aligns to the standard. However, one of the enduring problems with that approach is that as the template evolves over time in response to changing technical and business requirements, projects based on older versions of the template fall out of date.

The level of analysis made possible by Overwatch is deeper than what is allowed by cloud providers' cost analysis tools. For example, we were able to analyze the cost of job failures — recognizing that failing fast saves money compared to jobs that only fail near the final step — and break down the cost by various groupings (workspace, cluster, job, notebook, team). We also appreciated the improved operational visibility, as we could easily audit access controls around cluster configurations and analyze operational metrics like finding the longest running notebook or largest read/write volume.

    "descriptionHtml": "<p>When looking at reducing the carbon footprint of an application — the carbon dioxide emissions caused indirectly by running the software — attention is usually directed at making the software more efficient. The thinking is clear: more efficient software needs less electricity and fewer servers, reducing the emissions from electricity generation and manufacturing of the servers. An additional strategy is to make the application <em>carbon aware</em>. This is because the same workload does not always have the same carbon footprint. For example, when run in a data center in a cooler climate, less power for air conditioning is needed; or, when run at a time when more renewable energy is available (more sunshine, stronger winds), less electricity from carbon-based  sources is required.

Whereas developers can easily comprehend JSON payloads, OpenAPI (<a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/tools/swagger\">Swagger</a>) specs and <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/tools/postman\">Postman</a> demos, business stakeholders tend to respond better to demos they can interact with. The value of the product is more clearly articulated when you can see and touch it, which is why we sometimes find it worthwhile to invest in <strong>demo frontends for API-only products</strong>. When a custom graphical UI is built alongside an API product, stakeholders can see analogies to paper forms or reports that might be more familiar to them. As the interaction model and richness of the demo UI evolves, it allows them to make more informed decisions about the direction the API product should take. Working on the UI has the added benefit of increasing developers' empathy for business users. This isn't a new technique — we've been doing this successfully when necessary as long as API products have been around. However, because this technique isn't widely known, we thought it worthwhile calling attention to it.</p>",

In this approach, we get ChatGPT to generate tests for us, and then a developer implements the functionality. Specifically, we first describe the tech stack and the design patterns we're using in a prompt \"fragment\" that is reusable across multiple use cases. Then we describe the specific feature we want to implement, including the acceptance criteria. Based on all that, we ask ChatGPT to generate an implementation plan for that feature in our architectural style and tech stack. Once we sanity check that implementation plan, we ask it to generate tests for our acceptance criteria.</p>\n\n<p>This approach has worked surprisingly well for us: It required the team to come up with a concise description of their architectural style and helped junior developers and new team members code features aligned with the team’s existing style. The main drawback of this approach is that even though we don't give the model our source code, we still feed it potentially sensitive information such as our tech stack and feature descriptions. Teams should ensure they're working with their legal advisors to avoid any intellectual property issues, at least until a \"for business\" version of these AI tools becomes available.</p>",

For example, when one of our teams had unpredictable support issues, they saw a 25% increase in throughput and a 50% decrease in cycle time volatility by planning feature velocity based on only two of the three developer pairs' capacities.</p>",

Evolved from the corporate style guides of the past, design systems offer shared libraries and documents that are easy to find and use. Generally, guidance is written down as code and kept under version control so that the guide is less ambiguous and easier to maintain than simple documents. Design systems have become a standard approach when working across teams and disciplines in product development because they allow teams to focus. They can address strategic challenges around the product itself without reinventing the wheel every time a new visual component is needed.</p>\n\n<p>Our experiences show that teams seldom apply a product-centric mindset when building design systems. The primary consumers of the shared libraries and documents are the product development teams. When applying a product mindset, system owners should establish empathy with internal consumers (the development teams) and collaborate with them. We've found that the reason many component libraries are maligned is because the owning team wasn't able to give consumers what they needed fast enough and wasn't set up to take outside contributions. A product-centric mindset also requires organizations to think about if and how contributions should be made to the design system and how these contributions should be governed — on this topic, we recommend applying the <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/design-system-decision-records\">design system decision records</a> technique.

Even with the continual evolution of tools and techniques in this area, <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/tools/terraform\">Terraform</a> continues to be the dominant tool for doing IaC on cloud-native resources. However, most hosting environments today are complex combinations of cloud vendor–native services, third-party services and custom code. In these environments, we've found that engineers often resort to a mixture of Terraform for cloud resources and custom scripts for the rest. This can lead to a lack of consistency and repeatability in the provisioning process. In fact, many of the third-party services that are commonly used in hosting environments — including Splunk, Datadog, PagerDuty and New Relic — have Terraform providers that you can use to provision and configure these services.

As with those industries, software failure can also have dire consequences — compromising, for example, human health and privacy — which is why we're seeing an increased need for systems to undergo rigorous analysis. The process starts by identifying the possible failure modes. The team then performs a root cause analysis and assigns scores according to the likelihood of a failure occurring, the size of its impact and the probability of detecting the root cause of the failure. We've found this to be most effective when cross-functional teams iterate through this process as the system evolves.

Opens in new tab\" class=\"pop-out\">AWS Control Tower<span class=\"pop-out-icon\"></span></a></strong> addresses this challenge by simplifying setup and automating governance; it addresses regulatory requirements with guardrails. AWS Control Tower has a built-in Account Factory that helps automate the account provisioning workflow. Among other things, you can update, unmanage and close accounts that you create and provision through Account Factory. Due to its lack of automation and customization, Amazon introduced <a href=\"https://github.com/aws-ia/terraform-aws-control_tower_account_factory\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"AWS Control Tower Account Factory for Terraform (AFT).

AFT allows you to provision customizations to send webhooks or take specific actions that allow for the integration with other tools to kick off jobs as part of the account creation process. One of the use cases leveraged by our team was to manage a set of out-of-the box items for accounts that were set-and-forget configurations for baselining and creating access for roles for <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/github-actions\">GitHub Actions</a>. This resulted in providing developers with an account that’s security baselined with a fully integrated VPC, ready to receive workload via GitHub Actions. Our teams have reported great results using AWS Control Tower to manage accounts, as a single access control for multiple teams, and with leveraging AFT in their workloads.</p>",

It queries cloud APIs for resource usage data and uses multiple sources to track carbon emissions. Following a published methodology, CCF combines these into emission estimates and provides a visualization of the data over time. Cloud providers have started adding similar offerings to their platforms, but <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/clients/Bringing-green-cloud-optimization-to-a-green-energy-business\">organizations</a> are still deploying CCF because it has all of the following features: It's open-source, designed to be extended, works across multiple clouds and has a transparent, published methodology. In addition, it also includes estimates for scope 2 and scope 3 emissions — for electricity use and hardware production, respectively. In our experiments, the estimates between different tools have varied, which is not a huge surprise given that all tools in this space make estimates and multiply estimated numbers. However, settling on one tool, taking a baseline and improving from that baseline is the key usage scenario we've come across, and tools like <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/tools/kepler\">Kepler</a> may reduce the need for estimates in the future.

We see the need for a cache layer in front of LLMs for two main reasons — to improve the overall performance by reducing external API calls and to reduce the cost of operation by caching similar responses. Unlike traditional caching approaches that look for exact matches, LLM-based caching solutions require similar or related matches for the input queries. GPTCache approaches this with the help of embedding algorithms to convert the input queries into embeddings and then use a vector datastore for similarity search on these embeddings. One drawback of such a design is that you may encounter false positives during cache hits or false negatives during cache misses, which is why we recommend you carefully assess GPTCache for your LLM-based applications.</p>",

The context window — which determines the maximum size of the LLM input — is limited, which means that selecting the most relevant documents is crucial. We improve the relevancy of the content that is added to the prompt by reranking.

Any entity to be displayed or managed by Backstage is configured in the catalog-info file, which contains data such as status, lifecycle, dependencies and APIs among other details. By default, individual entity descriptors are written by hand and usually maintained and versioned by the team responsible for the component in question.

Also, there is always the possibility that changes are overlooked or that some components are missed entirely. We've found it more efficient and less error-prone to <strong>automatically generate Backstage entity descriptors</strong>. Most organizations have existing sources of information that can jump-start the process of populating catalog entries. Good development practices, for example, putting appropriate tags on AWS resources or adding metadata to source files, can simplify entity discovery and descriptor generation.

Manually checking for security vulnerabilities and adhering to regulations can slow down development and introduce errors. As an alternative, organizations can automate compliance checks and audits. They can integrate tools into software development pipelines, allowing teams to detect and address compliance issues early in the development process. Codifying compliance rules and best practices helps enforce policies and standards consistently across teams. It enables you to scan code changes for vulnerabilities, enforce coding standards and track infrastructure configuration changes to ensure they meet compliance requirements. Lastly, automated reporting of the above simplifies audits and provides clear evidence of compliance.

This is an external link. Opens in new tab\" class=\"pop-out\">bliki entry<span class=\"pop-out-icon\"></span></a> on the subject which indicates a test that requires live versions of all run-time dependencies. Such a test is obviously expensive, because it requires a full-featured test environment with all the necessary infrastructure, data and services. Managing the right versions of all those dependencies requires significant coordination overhead, which tends to slow down release cycles. Finally, the tests themselves are often fragile and unhelpful. For example, it takes effort to determine if a test failed because of the new code, mismatched version dependencies or the environment, and the error message rarely helps pinpoint the source of the error. Those criticisms don't mean that we take issue with automated \"black box\" integration testing in general, but we find a more helpful approach is one that balances the need for confidence with release frequency. This can be done in two stages by first validating the behavior of the system under test assuming a certain set of responses from run-time dependencies, and then validating those assumptions. The first stage uses service virtualization to create test doubles of run-time dependencies and validates the behavior of the system under test.

The allure of LLMs is undeniable; they offer a seemingly effortless solution to complex problems, and developers can often create such a solution quickly and without needing years of deep machine learning experience. It can be tempting to roll out an LLM-based solution as soon as it’s more or less working and then move on. Although these LLM-based proofs of value are useful, we advise teams to look carefully at what the technology is being used for and to consider whether an LLM is actually the right end-stage solution. Many problems that an LLM can solve — such as sentiment analysis or content classification — can be solved more cheaply and easily using traditional natural language processing (NLP). Analyzing what the LLM is doing and then analyzing other potential solutions not only mitigates the risks associated with <strong>overenthusiastic LLM use</strong> but also promotes a more nuanced understanding and application of AI technologies.</p>",

In the vast majority of these cases, using a form of <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag\">retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)</a> offers a better solution and a better cost-benefit ratio. Fine-tuning requires considerable computational resources and expertise and introduces even more challenges around sensitive and proprietary data than RAG. There is also a risk of underfitting, when you don't have enough data available for fine-tuning, or, less frequently, overfitting, when you have too much data and are therefore not hitting the right balance of task specificity that you need.

By generating real traffic and interacting with live endpoints, the tool can identify any discrepancies between what the API promises and what it delivers. This translates into several benefits for development teams. For example, it catches inconsistencies early in development, saving time and preventing issues from reaching production. The tool also helps improve API quality and security by identifying potential vulnerabilities arising from deviations from the documented behavior. Overall, API Scan helps you assess the security posture of your APIs by identifying problems such as weak authentication protocols, insecure data handling practices and insufficient input validation.

The inline chat can also change code, not just write new lines. You can now also significantly expand the context of the chat when asking questions about your code by using the <code>@workspace</code> tag. This allows you to ask questions about the entire codebase, not just the open files.

We’ve used this tool for the default use case of cost optimization as well as for disaster recovery (DR) contexts with good results. By automating cleanup in development and sandbox environments, aws-nuke helps minimize unnecessary resource expenditure. It also facilitates efficient teardown of temporary DR infrastructure after drills or exercises. Although stable, aws-nuke is a very destructive tool and is not intended to be used in production environments. Always perform a dry run to confirm that essential resources won’t be deleted.</p>",

Interactive changes to the System Initiative state result in corresponding change sets that can be applied to the infrastructure itself. Likewise, changes to the infrastructure are reflected in the System Initiative state. One of the great advantages of this approach is the collaborative environment it creates for things like application deployment and observability. Engineers interact with System Initiative through a user interface that has a graphical representation of the entire environment. In addition to managing the cloud infrastructure, you can also use the tool to manage containers, scripts, tools and more. Although we're generally skeptical of these kinds of GUI tools, System Initiative can be extended to handle new assets or enforce policy via TypeScript code. We really like the creative thinking that has gone into this tool and hope it will encourage others to break with the status quo of infrastructure-as-code approaches. System Initiative is free and open source under an Apache 2.0 license and is currently in open beta.

Like many open-source tools in this space, aider doesn’t have direct IDE integration but is started as a CLI in the terminal. aider is interesting because it provides a chat interface with write access to the codebase across multiple files, whereas many of the coding assistant products today either only read the code or can change only one file at a time. This allows aider to help you implement concepts that stretch over multiple files (e.g., \"add locators to my HTML and also use those in my functional test\") and to create new files and folder structures in the codebase (e.g., \"create a new component similar to the one in folder X\"). As aider is open source and not a hosted product, you have to bring your own OpenAI or Azure OpenAI API key to use it. On the one hand, this can be great for occasional use because you only have to pay per use. On the other hand, aider does seem to be quite chatty in its interactions with the AI API, so keep an eye on request costs and rate limits when using it.</p>",

While the framework offers a powerful set of features for building applications with large language models (LLMs), we’ve found it to be hard to use and overcomplicated. LangChain gained early popularity and attention in the space, which turned it into a default for many developers. However, as LangChain is trying to evolve and keep up with the fast pace of change, it has become harder and harder to navigate those changes of concepts and patterns as a developer. We’ve also found the API design to be inconsistent and verbose. As such, it often obscures what is actually going on under the hood, making it hard for developers to understand and control how LLMs and the various patterns around them actually work. We’re moving LangChain to the Hold ring to reflect this. In many of our use cases, we’ve found that an implementation with minimum use of specialized frameworks is sufficient.

This results in higher quality output and greatly reduced hallucinations. The context window — which determines the maximum size of the LLM input — has grown significantly with newer models, but selecting the most relevant documents is still a crucial step. Our experience indicates that a carefully constructed smaller context can yield better results than a broad and large context. Using a large context is also slower and more expensive.

Ironically, a common objection to the alternatives — either ephemeral environments or multiple on-prem test environments — is cost. However, this fails to take into account the cost of the delays caused by enterprise-wide integration test environments as development teams wait for other teams to finish or for new versions of dependent systems to be deployed. Instead, teams should use ephemeral environments and, preferably, a suite of tests owned by the development team that can be spun up and discarded cheaply, using fake stubs for their systems rather than actual replicas.

These models can be used to segment, synthesize, reconstruct and analyze video streams and images, sometimes in combination with diffusion models or standard convolutional neural networks. Despite the potential for LVMs to revolutionize the way we work with visual data, we still face significant challenges in adapting and applying them in production environments. Video data, for instance, presents unique engineering challenges for collecting training data, segmenting and labeling objects, fine-tuning models and then deploying the resulting models and monitoring them in production. So, while LLMs lend themselves to simple chat interfaces or plain text APIs, a computer vision engineer or data scientist must manage, version, annotate and analyze large quantities of streaming video data; this work requires a visual interface. <strong>LVM platforms</strong> are a new category of tools and services — including <a href=\"https://www.v7labs.com/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"V7.

It has an intuitive interface, customizable routes and dynamic responses as well as the ability to automate the creation of mock data sets. Mockoon is compatible with OpenAPI and lets you generate different scenarios that can be tested locally and integrated with a development pipeline. You can also create \"partial mocks\" by intercepting the requests and only faking the calls that are defined in Mockoon. The partial mocks help simulate specific API routes or endpoints and forward other requests to actual servers. While partial mocks can be useful in certain scenarios, there is a risk of overuse, which may lead to unnecessary complexity. Besides that, Mockoon remains a valuable tool for quickly setting up mock APIs as well as improving and automating development workflows.</p>",

These coding assistance tools do more than just help the engineer with code snippets here and there; they broaden the size of the problem they can solve, ideally autonomously and with minimum interference from a human. The idea is that these tools can take a GitHub issue or a Jira ticket and propose a plan and code changes to implement it, or even create a pull request for a human to review. While this is the next logical step to increase the impact of AI coding assistance, the often advertised goal of generic agents that can cover a broad range of coding tasks is very ambitious, and the current state of tooling is not showing that convincingly yet.

    "descriptionHtml": "<p>Preparing test data for data engineering is a significant challenge. Transferring data from production to test environments can be risky, so teams often rely on fake or synthetic data instead. In this Radar, we explored novel approaches like <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/synthetic-data-for-testing-and-training-models\">synthetic data for testing and training models</a>. But most of the time, lower-cost procedural generation is enough. <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/databrickslabs/dbldatagen\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"dbldatagen (Databricks Labs Data Generator). This is an external link. Opens in new tab\" class=\"pop-out\">dbldatagen (Databricks Labs Data Generator)<span class=\"pop-out-icon\"></span></a></strong> is such a tool; it’s a Python library for generating synthetic data within the Databricks environment for testing, benchmarking, demoing and many other uses. dbldatagen can generate synthetic data at scale, up to billions of rows within minutes, supporting various scenarios such as multiple tables, change data capture and merge/join operations. It can handle Spark SQL primitive types well, generate ranges and discrete values and apply specified distributions. When creating synthetic data using the Databricks ecosystem, dbldatagen is an option worth evaluating.</p>",
