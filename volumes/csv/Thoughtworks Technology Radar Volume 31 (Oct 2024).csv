The <strong>1% canary</strong> is a useful technique where we roll out new features to a very small segment (say 1%) of users carefully chosen across various user categories. This enables teams to capture fast user feedback, observe the impact of new releases on performance and stability and respond as necessary. This technique becomes especially crucial when teams are rolling out software updates to mobile applications or a fleet of devices like edge computing devices or software-defined vehicles. With proper observability and early feedback, it gives the opportunity to contain the blast radius in the event of unexpected scenarios in production. While canary releases can be useful to get faster user feedback, we believe starting with a small percentage of users is mandatory to reduce and contain the risk of large-scale feature rollouts.</p>"
Component testing,adopt,techniques,TRUE,new,"<p>Automated testing remains a cornerstone of effective software development.

In either case, though, teams should focus on <strong>component testing</strong> because test suites should be stable and run quickly. Instead, what we're seeing is that teams forgo mastering component testing in favor of end-to-end browser-based testing as well as very narrowly defined unit tests. Unit tests have a tendency to force components to expose what should be purely internal functionality, while browser-based tests are slow, more flaky and harder to debug. Our recommendation is to have a significant amount of component tests and use a library like <a href=""https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdom"" target=""_blank"" aria-label=""jsdom.

Continuous deployment,adopt,techniques,FALSE,moved in,"<p>We believe organizations should adopt <strong>continuous deployment</strong> practices whenever possible. Continuous deployment is the practice of automatically deploying every change that passes automated tests to production. This practice is a key enabler of fast feedback loops and allows organizations to deliver value to customers more quickly and efficiently. Continuous delivery differs from continuous deployment in that it only requires that code <em>can</em> be deployed at any time; it doesn't require that every change actually <em>is</em> deployed to production. We've hesitated to move continuous deployment into the Adopt ring in the past, as it’s a practice that requires a high level of maturity in other areas of software delivery and is therefore not appropriate for all teams. However, Thoughtworker Valentina Servile’s recent book <em><a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/continuous-deployment/9781098146719/"" target=""_blank"" aria-label=""Continuous Deployment.

Opens in new tab"" class=""pop-out"">Jugalbandi AI platform<span class=""pop-out-icon""></span></a>. With RAG, information about relevant and trustworthy documents is stored in a database. For a given prompt, the database is queried, relevant documents are retrieved and the prompt augmented with the content of the documents, thus providing richer context to the LLM. This results in higher quality output and greatly reduced hallucinations. The context window — which determines the maximum size of the LLM input — has grown significantly with newer models, but selecting the most relevant documents is still a crucial step. Our experience indicates that a carefully constructed smaller context can yield better results than a broad and large context. Using a large context is also slower and more expensive. We used to rely solely on embeddings stored in a vector database to identify additional context. Now, we're seeing reranking and hybrid search: search tools such as <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/elasticsearch-relevance-engine"">Elasticsearch Relevance Engine</a> as well as approaches like <a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/graphrag-unlocking-llm-discovery-on-narrative-private-data/"" target=""_blank"" aria-label=""GraphRAG.

Domain storytelling,trial,techniques,TRUE,new,"<p>Domain-driven design (DDD) has become a foundational approach to the way we develop software. We use it to model events, to guide software designs, to establish context boundaries around microservices and to elaborate nuanced business requirements. DDD establishes a ubiquitous language that both nontechnical stakeholders and software developers can use to communicate effectively about the business. Once established, domain models evolve, but many teams find it hard to get started with DDD. There’s no one-size-fits-all approach to building an initial domain model. One promising technique we've encountered recently is <strong><a href=""https://domainstorytelling.org/"" target=""_blank"" aria-label=""domain storytelling. This is an external link. Opens in new tab"" class=""pop-out"">domain storytelling<span class=""pop-out-icon""></span></a></strong>. Domain storytelling is a facilitation technique where business experts are prompted to describe activities in the business. As the experts are guided through their narration, a facilitator uses a pictographic language to capture the relationships and actions between entities and actors. The process of making these stories visible helps to clarify and develop a shared understanding among participants. Since there is no single best approach to developing a domain model, domain storytelling offers a noteworthy alternative or, for a more comprehensive approach to DDD, companion to <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/event-storming"">Event Storming</a>, another technique we often use to get started with DDD.</p>"
Fine-tuning embedding models,trial,techniques,TRUE,new,"<p>When building LLM applications based on <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag"">retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)</a>, the quality of embeddings directly impacts both retrieval of the relevant documents and response quality. <strong>Fine-tuning embedding models</strong> can enhance the accuracy and relevance of embeddings for specific tasks or domains.

However, consider the trade-offs of this approach before you <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/rush-to-fine-tune-llms"">rush to fine-tune</a> your embedding model.</p>"
Function calling with LLMs,trial,techniques,TRUE,new,"<p><strong>Function calling with LLMs</strong> refers to the ability to integrate LLMs with external functions, APIs or tools by determining and invoking the appropriate function based on a given query and associated documentation. This extends the utility of LLMs beyond text generation, allowing them to perform specific tasks such as information retrieval, code execution and API interaction. By triggering external functions or APIs, LLMs can perform actions that were previously outside their standalone capabilities. This technique enables LLMs to act on their outputs, effectively bridging the gap between thought and action — similar to how humans use tools to accomplish various tasks. By introducing function calling, LLMs add determinism and factuality to the generation process, striking a balance between creativity and logic. This method allows LLMs to connect to internal systems and databases or even perform internet searches via connected browsers. Models like OpenAI's GPT series support function calling and fine-tuned models like Gorilla are specifically designed to enhance the accuracy and consistency of generating executable API calls from natural language instructions. As a technique, function calling fits within <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag"">retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)</a> and agent architectures. It should be viewed as an abstract pattern of use, emphasizing its potential as a foundational tool in diverse implementations rather than a specific solution.</p>"
LLM as a judge,trial,techniques,TRUE,new,"<p>Many systems we build have two key characteristics: being able to provide an answer based on questions about a large data set, and being next to impossible to follow how it arrived at that answer. Despite this opacity we still want to assess and improve the quality of the responses. With the <strong>LLM as a judge</strong> pattern we use an LLM to evaluate the responses of another system, which in turn might be based on an LLM. We've seen this pattern used to evaluate the relevance of search results in a product catalog and to assess whether an LLM-based chatbot was guiding its users in a sensible direction. Naturally, the evaluator system must be set up and calibrated carefully. It can drive significant efficiency gains, which, in turn, translates to lower costs. This is an ongoing area of research, with the current state summarized in <a href=""https://eugeneyan.com/writing/llm-evaluators/#critiques-against-and-support-for-llm-evaluators"" target=""_blank"" aria-label=""this article.

Setting up a new login with passkeys generates a key pair: the website receives the public key and the user keeps the private key. Handling login uses asymmetric cryptography. The user proves they're in possession of the private key, which is stored on the user’s device and never sent to the website. Access to passkeys is protected using biometrics or a PIN. Passkeys can be stored and synced within the big tech ecosystems, using Apple's iCloud Keychain, Google Password Manager or Windows Hello.

The most common objection to using passkeys claims that they are a challenge for less tech-savvy users, which is, we believe, self-defeating. These are often the same users who have poor password discipline and would therefore benefit the most from alternative methods. In practice, systems that use passkeys can fall back to more traditional authentication methods if required.</p>"
Small language models,trial,techniques,TRUE,new,"<p>Large language models (LLMs) have proven useful in many areas of applications, but the fact that they are large can be a source of problems: responding to a prompt requires a lot of compute resources, making queries slow and expensive; the models are proprietary and so large that they must be hosted in a cloud by a third party, which can be problematic for sensitive data; and training a model is prohibitively expensive in most cases. The last issue can be addressed with the <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag"">RAG</a> pattern, which side-steps the need to train and fine-tune foundational models, but cost and privacy concerns often remain. In response, we’re now seeing growing interest in <strong>small language models (SLMs)</strong>. In comparison to their more popular siblings, they have fewer weights and less precision, usually between 3.5 billion and 10 billion parameters. <a href=""https://arxiv.org/html/2406.11402v2"" target=""_blank"" aria-label=""Recent research.

Synthetic data for testing and training models,trial,techniques,TRUE,new,"<p>Synthetic data set creation involves generating artificial data that can mimic real-world scenarios without relying on sensitive or limited-access data sources. While synthetic data for structured data sets has been explored extensively (e.g., for performance testing or privacy-safe environments), we're seeing renewed use of synthetic data for unstructured data.

OpenAI now supports structured output, allowing developers to supply a JSON Schema, <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks/pydantic"">pydantic</a> or Zod object to constrain model responses. This capability is particularly valuable for enabling function calling, API interactions and external integrations, where accuracy and adherence to a format are critical.

Enterprise-wide integration test environments,hold,techniques,FALSE,no change,"<p>Creating <strong>enterprise-wide integration test environments</strong> is a common, wasteful practice that slows everything down. These environments invariably become a precious resource that's hard to replicate and a bottleneck to development. They also provide a false sense of security due to inevitable discrepancies in data and configuration overhead between environments. Ironically, a common objection to the alternatives — either ephemeral environments or multiple on-prem test environments — is cost. However, this fails to take into account the cost of the delays caused by enterprise-wide integration test environments as development teams wait for other teams to finish or for new versions of dependent systems to be deployed. Instead, teams should use ephemeral environments and, preferably, a suite of tests owned by the development team that can be spun up and discarded cheaply, using fake stubs for their systems rather than actual replicas. For other techniques that support this alternative take a look at <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/consumer-driven-contract-testing"">contract testing</a>, <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/decoupling-deployment-from-release"">decoupling deployment from release</a>, <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/focus-on-mean-time-to-recovery"">focus on mean time to recovery</a> and <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/qa-in-production"">testing in production</a>.</p>"
LLM bans,hold,techniques,TRUE,new,"<p>Rather than instituting blanket <strong>LLM bans</strong> in the workplace, organizations should focus on providing access to an approved set of AI tools. A ban only pushes employees to find unapproved and potentially unsafe workarounds, creating unnecessary risks. Much like the early days of personal computing, people will use whatever tools they feel are effective to get their work done, regardless of the barriers in place. By not providing a safe and endorsed alternative, companies risk employees using unapproved LLMs which come with intellectual property, data leakage and liability risks. Instead, offering secure, enterprise-approved LLMs or AI tools ensures both safety and productivity.

Large vision model (LVM) platforms,assess,platforms,TRUE,new,"<p>Large language models (LLMs) grab so much of our attention these days, we tend to overlook ongoing developments in large vision models (LVMs). These models can be used to segment, synthesize, reconstruct and analyze video streams and images, sometimes in combination with diffusion models or standard convolutional neural networks. Despite the potential for LVMs to revolutionize the way we work with visual data, we still face significant challenges in adapting and applying them in production environments. Video data, for instance, presents unique engineering challenges for collecting training data, segmenting and labeling objects, fine-tuning models and then deploying the resulting models and monitoring them in production. So, while LLMs lend themselves to simple chat interfaces or plain text APIs, a computer vision engineer or data scientist must manage, version, annotate and analyze large quantities of streaming video data; this work requires a visual interface. <strong>LVM platforms</strong> are a new category of tools and services — including <a href=""https://www.v7labs.com/"" target=""_blank"" aria-label=""V7.

In those instances, we use SOPS to encrypt secrets in text files. SOPS integrates with cloud-managed keystores such as AWS and GCP Key Management Service (KMS) or Azure Key Vault as sources of encryption keys. It also works cross-platform and supports PGP keys. Several of our teams use SOPS by default when they have to manage secrets in the code repository.</p>"
Visual regression testing tools,adopt,tools,FALSE,moved in,"<p>We've highlighted <strong>visual regression testing tools</strong> before and have observed their algorithms evolve from primitive pixel-level comparison to sophisticated pattern-matching and optical character recognition (OCR). Early visual regression tools generated many false positives and were only useful in later stages of development when the interface became stable. <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/tools/backstopjs"">BackstopJS</a> avoids this problem by configuring selectors and viewports to pinpoint visual tests to specific elements on the page. But machine learning has made it easier to detect and compare visual elements more accurately, even if they happen to have moved or contain dynamic content. These tools have become steadily more useful and are well-positioned to take advantage of the latest developments in AI and machine learning.

Software engineering agents,assess,tools,TRUE,new,"<p>One of the hottest topics right now in the GenAI space is the concept of <strong>software engineering agents</strong>. These coding assistance tools do more than just help the engineer with code snippets here and there; they broaden the size of the problem they can solve, ideally autonomously and with minimum interference from a human. The idea is that these tools can take a GitHub issue or a Jira ticket and propose a plan and code changes to implement it, or even create a pull request for a human to review. While this is the next logical step to increase the impact of AI coding assistance, the often advertised goal of generic agents that can cover a broad range of coding tasks is very ambitious, and the current state of tooling is not showing that convincingly yet. However, we can see this working sooner rather than later for a more limited scope of straightforward tasks, freeing up developer time to work on more complex problems.
