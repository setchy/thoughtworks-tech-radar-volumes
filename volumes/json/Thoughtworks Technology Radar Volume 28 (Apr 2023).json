One key feature to remember, though: It's not just about team structure or renaming existing platform teams; it’s also about applying product-centric working practices within the team. Specifically, we've received feedback that teams face challenges with this technique unless they have a product-centric mindset. This likely means additional roles, such as a product manager, alongside changes to other areas, such as requirements gathering and the measurement of success. Working this way means establishing empathy with internal consumers (the development teams) and collaborating with them on the design. Platform product managers create roadmaps and ensure the platform delivers value to the business and enhances the developer experience. We continue to see this technique as key to building internal platforms to roll out new digital solutions quickly and efficiently.</p>\""

This encompasses a number of techniques: If available, authenticate your pipelines with your cloud provider via federated identity mechanisms like OIDC, instead of giving them direct access to secrets. Implement the principle of least privilege by minimizing the access of individual user or runner accounts, rather than employing \"\"god user accounts\"\" with unlimited access. Use your runners in an ephemeral way instead of reusing them, to reduce the risk of exposing secrets from previous jobs or running jobs on compromised runners. Keep the software in your agents and runners up to date. Monitor the integrity, confidentiality and availability of your CI/CD systems the same way you would monitor your production software.</p><br><br><p>We're seeing teams forget about these types of practices particularly when they’re used to working with a self-managed CI/CD infrastructure in internal network zones. While all of these practices are important in your internal networks, they become even more crucial when using a managed service, as that extends the attack surface and blast radius even more.</p>\""

Running at less than full utilization means teams can be more thoughtful about the robustness of the resulting software and pay closer attention to the right observability signals. Our experience is that a fully utilized team leads to a collapse in throughput as well, just as a fully utilized highway creates slow and demoralizing traffic. For example, when one of our teams had unpredictable support issues, they saw a 25% increase in throughput and a 50% decrease in cycle time volatility by planning feature velocity based on only two of the three developer pairs' capacities.</p>\""

In the last year, we've seen an increase in SolidJS's visibility and popularity among developers, particularly those interested in creating richer user interactions. SolidJS compiles its templates to real DOM nodes (instead of using vDOM) and updates them with fine-grained reactions which reduces unnecessary DOM updates and results in faster performance and a better user experience. It has a simple API and great support for <a href=\"\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks/typescript\"\">TypeScript</a>, which can help catch errors during development. Another benefit of SolidJS is its small bundle size, which is ideal for building fast and lightweight web applications and benefits a mobile-first approach. SolidJS is a relatively new framework, so it doesn't have as large of a community or ecosystem as other frameworks. However, judging by the growing number of useful libraries and tools, it seems to be growing in popularity. Its reactive update system, functional component model and templating system make SolidJS an attractive choice to assess, and we're seeing interest from several teams and communities.</p>\""

We've found that the documentation is sparse, leading some teams to stick with more established tools for now.
