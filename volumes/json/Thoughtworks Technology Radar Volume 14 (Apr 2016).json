We recommend strictly using the term <em>Deployment</em> when referring to the act of deploying a change to application components or infrastructure. The term <em>Release</em> should be used when a feature change is released to end users, with a business impact. Using techniques such as feature toggles and dark launches, we can deploy changes to production systems more frequently without releasing features. More-frequent deployments reduce the risk associated with change, while business stakeholders retain control over when features are released to end users.</p>\""
