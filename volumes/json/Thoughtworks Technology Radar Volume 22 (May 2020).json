In this situation a red build can block multiple devs or pairs of devs. Instead of fixing the underlying root cause — slow builds, the inability to run tests locally or monolithic architectures that necessitate many people working in the same area — teams usually rely on feature branches to bypass these issues. We discourage feature branches, given they may require significant effort to resolve merge conflicts, and they introduce longer feedback loops and potential bugs during conflict resolution. Instead, we propose using <strong>preflight builds</strong> as an alternative: these are pull request–based builds for “micro branches” that live only for the duration of the pipeline run, with the branch opened for every commit.

This fails to realize the cloud's promises of agility and digital innovation. A cloud migration requires intentional change across multiple axes toward a cloud-native state, and depending on the unique migration circumstances, each organization might end up somewhere on the spectrum from cloud lift and shift to cloud native. Systems architecture, for example, is one of the pillars of delivery agility and often requires change.

The IT operating model too has to be reformed to safely provide cloud services through self-serve automated platforms and empower teams to take more of the operational responsibility and gain autonomy. Last but not least, organizations must build a foundation to enable continuous change, such as creating pipelines with continuous testing of applications and infrastructure as a part of the migration.

At a time when teams are searching for good remote collaboration options, we want to call attention to the excellent tooling here. Live Share provides a good, low-latency remote-pairing experience, and requires significantly less bandwidth than the brute-force approach of sharing your entire desktop. Importantly, developers can work with their preferred configuration, extensions and key mappings during a pairing session. In addition to real-time collaboration for editing and debugging code, Live Share allows voice calls and sharing terminals and servers.</p>\""

What we're seeing at the moment is <strong>Node overload</strong>, a tendency to use Node.js indiscriminately or for the wrong reasons. Among these, two stand out in our opinion. Firstly, we frequently hear that Node should be used so that all programming can be done in one programming language. Our view remains that <a href=\"\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/polyglot-programming\"\">polyglot programming</a> is a better approach, and this still goes <a href=\"\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks/javascript-as-a-first-class-language\"\">both ways</a>. Secondly, we often hear teams cite performance as a reason to choose Node.js. Although there are myriads of more or less sensible benchmarks, this perception is rooted in history. When Node.js became popular, it was the first major framework to embrace a nonblocking programming model which made it very efficient for IO-heavy tasks. (We mentioned this in our write-up of Node.js in 2012.) Due to its single-threaded nature, Node.js was never a good choice for compute-heavy workloads, though, and now that capable nonblocking frameworks also exist on other platforms — some with elegant, modern APIs — performance is no longer a reason to choose Node.js.</p>\""
