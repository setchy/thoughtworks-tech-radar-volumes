APIs as a product,trial,techniques,FALSE,no change,"<p>Companies have wholeheartedly embraced APIs as a way to expose business capabilities to both external and internal developers. APIs promise the ability to experiment quickly with new business ideas by recombining core capabilities. But what differentiates an API from an ordinary enterprise integration service? One difference lies in treating <strong>APIs as a product</strong> , even when the consumer is an internal system or fellow developer. Teams that build APIs should understand the needs of their customers and make the product compelling to them. Usability testing and UX research can lead to a better design and understanding of the API usage patterns and help bring a product mindset to APIs. APIs, like products, should be actively maintained and supported, and, easy to use. They should have an owner who advocates for the customer and strives for continual improvement. In our experience, product orientation is the missing ingredient that makes the difference between ordinary enterprise integration and an agile business built on a platform of APIs.</p>"

Hosting PII data in the EU,trial,techniques,FALSE,no change,"<p>In a number of countries, we see government agencies seeking broad access to private, personally identifiable information (PII). The increased use of public cloud solutions makes it more difficult for organizations to protect the data entrusted to them by their users while also respecting all relevant laws. The European Union has some of the most progressive privacy laws, and all the major cloud providers—Amazon, Google and Microsoft—offer multiple data centers and regions within the European Union. Therefore, we recommend that companies, especially those with a global user base, assess the feasibility of a safe haven for their users' data by <strong>hosting PII data in the EU</strong>. Since we wrote about this technique in the last Radar, we have rolled out a new internal system that handles sensitive information relating to all our employees, and we have chosen to host it in a data center located in the European Union.</p>"
Legacy in a box,trial,techniques,TRUE,new,"<p>Working with legacy code, especially large monoliths, is one of the most unsatisfying, high-friction <a href=""https://thoughtworks.wistia.com/medias/ogq5b8d80y"" target=""_blank"" aria-label=""experiences for developers. This is an external link. Opens in new tab"" class=""pop-out"">experiences for developers<span class=""pop-out-icon""></span></a>. Although we caution against extending and actively maintaining legacy monoliths, they continue to be dependencies in our environments, and developers often underestimate the cost and time required to develop against these dependencies. To help reduce the friction, developers have used virtualized <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/machine-image-as-a-build-artifact"">machine images</a> or container images with <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/docker"">Docker</a> containers to create immutable images of legacy systems and their configurations. The intent is to contain the <strong>legacy in a box</strong> for developers to run locally and remove the need for rebuilding, reconfiguring or sharing environments. In an ideal scenario, teams that own legacy systems generate the corresponding boxed legacy images through their build pipelines, and developers can then run and orchestrate these images in their allocated sandbox more reliably. Although this approach has reduced the overall time spent by each developer, it has had limited success when the teams owning the downstream dependencies have been reluctant to create container images for others to use.</p>"

Prototyping with InVision and Sketch,trial,techniques,TRUE,new,"<p>The combined use of InVision and Sketch has changed the way some people approach web application development. Although these are tools, it is really the technique of <strong>prototyping with InVision and Sketch</strong> that makes this blip significant. Creating rich, clickable prototypes as the starting point for implementing front-end and back-end behavior helps speed up the development and eliminates churn in the implementation details. This combined use of these tools strikes the right balance between premature elaboration of visual detail and capturing early user feedback on the interactive experience.</p>"

Client-directed query,assess,techniques,FALSE,no change,"<p>Although many problems that people encounter with RESTful approaches to APIs can be attributed to the <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/anemic-rest"">anemic REST</a> antipattern, some use cases warrant exploration of other approaches. In particular, organizations that have to support a long tail of client applications (and thus a likely proliferation of API versions even if they employ <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/consumer-driven-contract-testing"">consumer-driven contracts</a>)—and have a large portion of their APIs supporting the endless-list style of activity feeds—may hit some limits in RESTful architectures. These can sometimes be mitigated by employing the <strong>client-directed query</strong> approach to client-server interaction.

Container security scanning,assess,techniques,FALSE,no change,"<p>The container revolution instigated by <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/docker"">Docker</a> has massively reduced the friction in moving applications between environments but at the same time has blown a rather large hole in the traditional controls over what can go to production.

However, a more conversational style of input (voice or text) can be hard to build on top of many existing APIs, especially when it comes to a more stateful style of interaction where a follow-up interaction needs to be aware of the overall conversational context. In this style of interaction, for example, we'd like to inquire about trains from Manchester to Glasgow and then being able to ask ""What time is the first departure?"" without having to give the context of the conversation again. Normally this context would be present in the initial response we send back to a browser, but in the case of voice interfaces we need to handle this context elsewhere. <strong>Conversationally aware APIs</strong> can be an example of the <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/bff-backend-for-frontends"">backend for front-end pattern</a> where the front-end is a voice or chat platform.

Micro frontends,assess,techniques,FALSE,no change,"<p>We've seen significant benefit from introducing <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/microservices"">microservice architectures</a>, which have allowed teams to scale delivery of independently deployed and maintained services. However, teams have often struggled to avoid the creation of front-end monoliths—large and sprawling browser applications that are as difficult to maintain and evolve as the monolithic server-side applications we've abandoned. We're seeing an approach emerge that our teams call <strong>micro frontends</strong>. In this approach, a web application is broken up by its pages and features, with each feature being owned end-to-end by a single team. Multiple techniques exist to bring the application features—some old and some new—together as a cohesive user experience, but the goal remains to allow each feature to be developed, tested and deployed independently from others. The <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/bff-backend-for-frontends"">BFF - backend for frontends</a> approach works well here, with each team developing a BFF to support its set of application features.</p>"
Platform engineering product teams,assess,techniques,TRUE,new,"<p>The adoption of cloud and DevOps, while increasing the productivity of teams who can now move more quickly with reduced dependency on centralized operations teams and infrastructure, also has constrained teams who lack the skills to self-manage a full application and operations stack. Some organizations have tackled this challenge by creating <strong>platform engineering product teams</strong>. These teams operate an internal platform which enables delivery teams to self-service deploy and operate systems with reduced lead time and stack complexity. The emphasis here is on API-driven self-service and supporting tools, with delivery teams still responsible for supporting what they deploy onto the platform. Organizations that consider establishing such a platform team should be very cautious not to accidentally create a <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/separate-devops-team"">separate DevOps team</a>, nor should they simply relabel their <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/superficial-private-cloud"">existing hosting and operations structure</a> as a platform.</p>"
Social code analysis,assess,techniques,TRUE,new,"<p><strong>Social code analysis</strong> enriches our understanding of the code quality by overlaying a developer's behavior with the structural analysis of the code.

VR beyond gaming,assess,techniques,FALSE,no change,"<p>The idea of virtual reality has been around for more than 50 years, and with successive advancements in computing technology many ideas have been hyped and explored. We believe that we've reached a tipping point. Reasonably affordable consumer-oriented VR headsets were shipped to the market last year, and modern graphics cards provide sufficient power to create immersive experiences with them. The headsets are mainly targeted at video game enthusiasts, but we're convinced that they'll open the doors to many possibilities for <strong>VR beyond gaming</strong>. Teams without experience in building video games should not underestimate the effort and skill required to create good 3-D models and convincing textures.</p>"
A single CI instance for all teams,hold,techniques,FALSE,no change,"<p>We're compelled to caution, again, against creating <strong>a single CI instance for all teams</strong>. While it's a nice idea in theory to consolidate and centralize Continuous Integration (CI) infrastructure, in reality we do not see enough maturity in the tools and products in this space to achieve the desired outcome. Software delivery teams which must use the centralized CI offering regularly have long delays depending on a central team to perform minor configuration tasks, or to troubleshoot problems in the shared infrastructure and tooling. At this stage, we continue to recommend that organizations limit their centralized investment to establishing patterns, guidelines and support for delivery teams to operate their own CI infrastructure.</p>"
Anemic REST,hold,techniques,FALSE,no change,"<p>With the increasing popularity of the <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/bff-backend-for-frontends"">BFF - Backend for frontends</a> pattern and use of one-way data-binding frameworks like <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks/react-js"">React.js</a>, we've noticed a backlash against REST-style architectures. Critics accuse REST of causing chatty, inefficient interactions among systems and failing to adapt as client needs evolve. They offer frameworks such as <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks/graphql"">GraphQL</a> or <a href=""https://netflix.github.io/falcor/"" target=""_blank"" aria-label=""Falcor. This is an external link. Opens in new tab"" class=""pop-out"">Falcor<span class=""pop-out-icon""></span></a> as alternative data-fetch mechanisms that let the client specify the format of the data returned. But in our experience, it isn't REST that causes these problems. Rather, they stem from a failure to properly model the domain as a set of resources. Naively developing services that simply expose static, hierarchical data models via templated URLs result in an <strong>anemic REST</strong> implementation. In a richly modeled domain, REST should enable more than simple repetitive data fetching. In a fully evolved RESTful architecture, business events and abstract concepts are also modeled as resources, and the implementation should make effective use of hypertext, link relations and media types to maximize decoupling between services.

Enterprise-wide integration test environments,hold,techniques,TRUE,new,"<p>When the enterprise-wide quarterly or monthly releases were considered best practice, it was necessary to maintain a complete environment for performing testing cycles prior to deployment to production. These <strong>enterprise-wide integration test environments</strong> (often referred to as SIT or Staging) are a common bottleneck for continuous delivery today. The environments themselves are fragile and expensive to maintain, often with components that need manual configuration by a separate environment management team. Testing in the staging environment provides unreliable and slow feedback, and testing effort is duplicated with what can be performed on components in isolation. We recommend that organizations incrementally create an independent path to production for key components.
