Second, if the JavaScript doesn’t behave exactly as you want you will have to hack the generated code.

Google App Engine, Amazon EC2 and Salesforce.com all claim to be Cloud providers, yet each of their offerings differ. The Cloud fits into a broad categorization of service offerings split out into Infrastructure as a Service (e.g. Amazon EC2 and Rackspace), Platform as a Service (e.g. App Engine) and Software as a Service (e.g. Salesforce.com). In some cases, providers may span multiple service categories, further diluting the Cloud as a label.

Two characteristics of functional languages in particular are driving this interest, immutability with its implications for parallelism and functions as first class objects. While the introduction of closures to C# brings some of the latter capability, functional languages are almost synonymous with immutability. The placement of these languages within the assess ring indicates our view of their relative maturity and appropriateness. F#, based on OCaml, is fully supported within the Visual Studio toolset. F# includes support for objects and imperative constructs in addition to functional language constructs in a natural way. Scala, like F#, combines the object and functional paradigms, although the syntax of Scala is more Java-like. Clojure began as a JVM language and is now available on the .NET CLR. Clojure does allow for mutable state although it has an extensive set of immutable persistent data structures, all supporting multi-threaded applications. There are many similarities between these three languages, but at the moment we believe F# and Clojure to be better suited to most organizations for assessing than Scala.

Moving to an often terse syntax for solving complex problems may initially be intimidating to many. As with all forms of programming languages, syntax is just one aspect of the language itself. In functional programming another significant aspect is the use of common idioms. These idioms speed code comprehension and increase overall maintainability. This might not be news to all, but it is worth noting that dynamic languages are long ready for adoption and trial. Ruby, particularly when deployed on JRuby, is ready for adoption. Thoughtworks uses Ruby and JRuby extensively in both its Services and Product work. Groovy is ready for trial and could prove more accessible than Ruby/JRuby in a Java shop.

Capabilities describe an organization’s operating model in terms of goals and competencies (what is to be done), rather than implementation specifics (how things are done). Whereas business architecture models based on people, process or technology are contingent, volatile and often short lived, and therefore ill-suited to the long-term planning needs of the organization, capability models provide a description of the business context that is stable enough to serve as a basis for identifying and prioritising technology and process initiatives.",

The key challenge is the different ways to install the driver and start the browser, but this only needs to be solved once. We suggest that companies doing mobile web for these devices try this approach. We see no reason why this approach cannot be extended to Windows Phone in the future.",

An alternative architecture is starting to emerge in implementations like Node.js (a JavaScript server running on Google V8), Nginx (an open source web server and proxy), and Webbit (a Java application server), that uses a single thread to serve many connections, processing all I/O asynchronously.

In the cloud, many systems scale automatically, either to provide additional availability or in response to increased demand. Crucial to managing a growing estate, immutable servers, or ‘phoenix servers’, are a sensible approach for enterprises looking at IaaS and PaaS. In contrast, custom-configured ‘snowflake servers’ increase the load on the operations group and encourage a “works on my machine” mentality. Being able to re-provision machines - hard or virtual - from scratch using tools such as Chef or Puppet can drastically reduce the complexity of managing large server farms. Coupled with software that is designed to withstand failure, this will lead to more scalable and reliable systems.",

In much the same way that DevOps has recast how historically adversarial groups can work together, the same is happening for security and development professionals.

There is little support for testing and a real danger to get into <em>event hell</em>. We do like that it uses functional mixins for behavior, like composition instead of inheritance.</p>",

For example, being able to add new class of stock to a website is not just about having an easy-to-change CMS; you also need to update the database, integration points, warehouse systems, etc. The recognition that some parts of an architecture need to be more maneuverable than others is useful. However, a focus on layers is proving unhelpful.</p>",

With Kylin you can define cubes using a Cube Designer and initiate an offline process that builds these cubes. The offline process performs a pre-join step to join facts and dimension tables into a flattened out structure. This is followed by a pre-aggregation phase where individual cuboids are built using Map Reduce jobs. The results are stored in HDFS sequence files and are later loaded into HBase. The data requests can originate from SQL submitted using a SQL-based tool. The query engine (based on <strong>Apache Calcite</strong> ), determines if the target dataset exists in HBase. If so, the engine directly accesses the target data from HBase and returns the result with sub-second latency. If not, the engine routes the queries to <strong>Hive</strong> (or any other SQL on Hadoop solution enabled on the cluster).</p>",

It offers a suite of extensions that allow you to use it as a full-blown test runner too, although we discourage the record and replay style of testing it promotes.</p>",

An example architecture could be a JavaScript app with static assets served by a CDN or S3 coupled with AJAX calls served by the API Gateway and Lambda. While serverless architectures have significant benefits, there are drawbacks too: Deploying, managing and sharing code across services is more complex, and local or offline testing is more difficult if not impossible.</p>",

Distributed map-reduce algorithms are a handy technique for large data sets, but many data sets we see could easily fit in a single-node relational or graph database. Even if you do have more data than that, usually the best thing to do is to first pick out the data you need, which can often then be processed on such a single node. So we urge that before you spin up your clusters, take a realistic assessment of what you need to process, and if it fits—maybe in RAM—use the simple option.</p>",

Critics accuse REST of causing chatty, inefficient interactions among systems and failing to adapt as client needs evolve.

But in our experience, it isn’t REST that causes these problems. Rather, they stem from a failure to properly model the domain as a set of resources. Naively developing services that simply expose static, hierarchical data models via templated URLs result in an <strong>anemic REST</strong> implementation. In a richly modeled domain, REST should enable more than simple repetitive data fetching. In a fully evolved RESTful architecture, business events and abstract concepts are also modeled as resources, and the implementation should make effective use of hypertext, link relations and media types to maximize decoupling between services.

Often teams can self-provision a restricted set of fixed service types with limited access and little ability to customize the centrally governed “enterprise blueprints,” leading to kludge solutions. Deployment pace regularly remains constrained by manually provisioned infrastructure such as network, firewall and storage. We encourage organizations to more fully consider the costs of mandating the use of an inadequate private cloud offering.</p>",

In a richly modeled domain, REST should enable more than simple repetitive data fetching. In a fully evolved RESTful architecture, business events and abstract concepts are also modeled as resources, and the implementation should make effective use of hypertext, link relations and media types to maximize decoupling between services.

We find that these platforms are most effective when they're given the same respect as an external product offering. <strong>Applying product management to internal platforms</strong> means establishing empathy with internal consumers (read: developers) and collaborating with them on the design. Platform product managers establish roadmaps and ensure the platform delivers value to the business and enhances the developer experience. Some owners even create a brand identity for the internal platform and use that to market the benefits to their colleagues. Platform product managers look after the quality of the platform, gather usage metrics, and continuously improve it over time. Treating the platform as a product helps to create a thriving ecosystem and avoids the pitfall of building yet another stagnant, underutilized service-oriented architecture.</p>",

A typical implementation involves lightweight reverse-proxy processes deployed alongside each service process, perhaps in a separate container.

This, of course, leads to <strong>generic cloud usage</strong>.

We see organizations making large investments in home-grown abstraction layers that are too complex to build and too costly to maintain to stay cloud agnostic. The problem of lock-in is real. We recommend approaching this problem with a multicloud strategy that evaluates the migration cost and effort of capabilities from one cloud to another, against the benefits of using cloud-specific features. We recommend increasing the portability of the workloads by shipping the applications as widely adopted <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/docker\">Docker</a> containers: use open source security and identity protocols to easily migrate the identity of the workloads, a <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/risk-commensurate-vendor-strategy\">risk-commensurate vendor strategy</a> to maintain cloud independence only where necessary and <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/polycloud\">Polycloud</a> to mix and match services from different providers where it makes sense.

The fundamental problem is that the source of the data has no incentive and accountability for providing quality data to its consumers. For this reason, we strongly advocate for <strong>data integrity at the origin</strong>, by which we mean, any source that provides consumable data must describe its measures of data quality explicitly and guarantee those measures.

We're hoping that ADF will address these concerns to support for more complex data-processing workflows and prioritize access to capabilities through code first.</p>",

As always there are antipatterns, too. A common one in this case is <strong>front-end integration via artifact</strong>. For each micro frontend an artifact is built, usually an NPM package, which is pushed into a registry. A later step, sometimes in a different build pipeline, then combines the individual packages into a final package that contains all micro frontends. From a purely technical perspective this integration at build time results in a working application. However, integrating via artifact implies that for each change the full artifact needs to be rebuilt, which is time consuming and will likely have a negative impact on developer experience. Worse, this style of integrating frontends also introduces direct dependencies between the micro frontends at build time and therefore causes considerable coordination overhead.</p>",

Several of these components are packaged as Kubernetes operators to draw on Kubernetes's ability to react to events generated by pods implementing various stages of the workflow. By packaging the individual programs and data as containers, entire workflows can be ported from one environment to another.

These teams maintain an internal platform that enables delivery teams to deploy and operate systems with reduced lead time and stack complexity. The emphasis here is on API-driven self-service and supporting tools, with delivery teams still responsible for supporting what they deploy onto the platform.

Unlike either unsupervised learning where a machine infers classes in unlabeled data or supervised techniques where the training set is entirely labeled, semi-supervised techniques take advantage of a small set of labeled data and a much larger set of unlabeled data. Semi-supervised learning is also closely related to active learning techniques where a human is directed to selectively label ambiguous data points. Since expert humans that can accurately label data are a scarce resource and labeling is often the most time-consuming activity in the machine-learning workflow, semi-supervised techniques lower the cost of training and make machine learning feasible for a new class of users.

For IE11 and other browsers that don't support ESM, a workaround is available.

(We mentioned this in our write-up of Node.js in 2012.) Due to its single-threaded nature, Node.js was never a good choice for compute-heavy workloads, though, and now that capable nonblocking frameworks also exist on other platforms — some with elegant, modern APIs — performance is no longer a reason to choose Node.js.</p>",

Although the principles are intuitive and attempt to address many of the known challenges of previous centralized analytical data management, they transcend the available analytical data technologies.

This continuing trend compelled us to highlight <strong>zero trust architecture</strong> (ZTA) again.</p>\n\n<p>ZTA is a paradigm shift in security architecture and strategy. It’s based on the assumption that a network perimeter is no longer representative of a secure boundary and no implicit trust should be granted to users or services based solely on their physical or network location. The number of resources, tools and platforms available to implement aspects of ZTA keeps growing and includes: enforcing <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/security-policy-as-code\">policies as code</a> based on the least privilege and as granular as possible principles and continuous monitoring and automated mitigation of threats; using <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/service-mesh\">service mesh</a> to enforce security control application-to-service and service-to-service; implementing <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/binary-attestation\">binary attestation</a> to verify the origin of the binaries; and including <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/secure-enclaves\">secure enclaves</a> in addition to traditional encryption to enforce the three pillars of data security: in transit, at rest and in memory.

The library is mature and full-featured.

But with rising security threats, eliminating all possible attack vectors is more important than ever. That's why <strong>distroless Docker images</strong> are becoming the default choice for deployment containers. Distroless Docker images reduce the footprint and dependencies by doing away with a full operating system distribution. This technique reduces security scan noise and the application attack surface. Moreover, fewer vulnerabilities need to be patched and as a bonus, these smaller images are more efficient.

Opens in new tab\" class=\"pop-out\">Bazel<span class=\"pop-out-icon\"></span></a> or simply use multistage Dockerfiles. Note that distroless containers by default don't have a shell for debugging.

Distroless Docker images is a technique pioneered by Google and, in our experience, is still largely confined to Google-generated images. We would be more comfortable if there were more than one provider to choose from. Also, use caution when applying  <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/tools/trivy\">Trivy</a> or similar vulnerability scanners since distroless containers are only supported in more recent versions.</p>",

An alternative, more successful method is to apply <strong>hypothesis-driven legacy renovation</strong>. Rather than working toward a standard backlog, the team takes ownership of a measurable technical outcome and collectively establishes a set of hypotheses about the problem.

That sort of \"outside-in\" approach works well for a number of legacy systems, but now that we've had enough experience with single-page applications (SPA) for them to become legacy systems themselves, we're seeing the opposite \"inside-out\" approach used to replace them. Instead of wrapping the legacy system, we instead embed the beginning of the new SPA into the HTML document containing the old one and let it slowly expand in functionality. The SPA frameworks don't even need to be the same as long as users can tolerate the performance hit of the increased page size (e.g., embedding a new <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks/react-js\">React</a> app inside an old <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks/angularjs\">AngularJS</a> one). <strong>SPA injection</strong> allows you to iteratively remove the old SPA until the new one completely takes over. Whereas a strangler fig can be viewed as a type of parasite that uses the host tree's stable external surface to support itself until it takes root and the host itself dies, this approach is more like injecting an outside agent into the host, relying on functionality of the original SPA until it can completely take over.</p>",

In this technique, a single set of type definitions is used to define both the data objects returned by front-end queries and the data served to satisfy those queries by the back-end server. Ordinarily, we would be cautious about this practice because of the unnecessarily tight coupling it creates across process boundaries. However, many teams are finding that the benefits of this approach outweigh any risks of tight coupling. Since the BFF pattern works best when the same team owns both the UI code and the BFF, often storing both components in the same repository, the UI/BFF pair can be viewed as a single cohesive system. When the BFF offers strongly typed queries, the results can be tailored to the specific needs of the frontend rather than reusing a single, general-purpose entity that must serve the needs of many consumers and contain more fields than actually required. This reduces the risk of accidentally exposing data that the user shouldn't see, prevents incorrect interpretation of the returned data object and makes the query more expressive. This practice is particularly useful when implemented with <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks/io-ts\">io-ts</a> to enforce the run-time type safety.</p>",

But the opportunity for developers to start small and easily customize behavior means that GitHub Actions are moving toward the default category for smaller projects.

    "descriptionHtml": "<p>As more businesses turn to events as a way to share data among microservices, collect analytics or feed data lakes, <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/tools/apache-kafka\">Apache Kafka</a> has become a favorite platform to support an event-driven architectural style. Although Kafka was a revolutionary concept in scalable persistent messaging, a lot of moving parts are required to make it work, including ZooKeeper, brokers, partitions, and mirrors. While these can be particularly tricky to implement and operate, they do offer great flexibility and power when needed, especially at an industrial enterprise scale. Because of the high barrier to entry presented by the full Kafka ecosystem, we welcome the recent explosion of platforms offering the <strong>Kafka API without Kafka</strong>. Recent entries such as <a href=\"https://github.com/streamnative/kop\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"Kafka on Pulsar. This is an external link.

At first glance, you would be forgiven for asking why the world needs another message queueing system. Message queues have been around in various forms for nearly as long as businesses have been using computers and have undergone years of refinement and optimization for various tasks. But NATS has several interesting characteristics and is unique in its ability to scale from embedded controllers to global, cloud-hosted superclusters. We're particularly intrigued by NATS's intent to support a continuous streaming flow of data from mobile devices and IoT and through a network of interconnected systems. However, some tricky issues need to be addressed, not the least of which is ensuring consumers see only the messages and topics to which they're allowed access, especially when the network spans organizational boundaries. NATS 2.0 introduced a security and access control framework that supports multitenant clusters where accounts restrict a user's access to queues and topics. Written in Go, NATS has primarily been embraced by the Go language community. Although clients exist for pretty much all widely used programming languages, the Go client is by far the most popular. However, some of our developers have found that all the language client libraries tend to reflect the Go origins of codebase. Increasing bandwidth and processing power on small, wireless devices means that the volume of data businesses must consume in real time will only increase. Assess NATS as a possible platform for streaming that data within and among businesses.</p>",

It also lets you distinguish between local and remote modules, where the remote modules are not actually part of the build itself but loaded asynchronously. Compared to build-time dependencies like npm packages, this can significantly simplify the deployment of a module update with many downstream dependencies.

And we're increasingly seeing misguided measurement approaches with tools that help teams measure these metrics based purely on their continuous delivery (CD) pipelines. In particular when it comes to the stability metrics (MTTR and change fail percentage), CD pipeline data alone doesn't provide enough information to determine what a deployment failure with real user impact is. Stability metrics only make sense if they include data about real incidents that degrade service for the users.</p>\n\n<p>And as with all metrics, we recommend to always keep in mind the ultimate intention behind a measurement and use them to reflect and learn.

Code is usually the only trustworthy source of truth because staff turnover and existing documentation are outdated. Therefore it's very important to reestablish the association between the documentation and the code and spread the business knowledge among the team when we take over a legacy system. In practice, we would first try to go to the codebase and deepen our understanding of the business through simple cleanup and safe refactoring. During the process, we'll need to add annotations to the code so that we're able to automatically generate living documentation later. This is very different from doing BDD in green-field projects, but it's a good start in legacy systems. Based on the generated documentation, we would try to convert some of the specs into executable high-level automation tests.

    "descriptionHtml": "<p>We're seeing increasing use of the <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/tools/kubernetes-operators\">Kubernetes Operator</a> pattern for purposes other than managing applications deployed on the cluster. Using the <strong>operator pattern for nonclustered resources</strong> takes advantage of custom resource definitions and the event-driven scheduling mechanism implemented in the Kubernetes control plane to manage activities that are related to yet outside of the cluster. This technique builds on the idea of <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/kube-managed-cloud-services\">Kube-managed cloud services</a> and extends it to other activities, such as continuous deployment or reacting to changes in external repositories. One advantage of this technique over a purpose-built tool is that it opens up a wide range of tools that either come with Kubernetes or are part of the wider ecosystem. You can use commands such as <code>diff</code>, <code>dry-run</code> or <code>apply</code> to interact with the operator's custom resources. Kube's scheduling mechanism makes development easier by eliminating the need to orchestrate activities in the proper order.

Much of the document is devoted to improving the security of the software supply chain. One item in particular that caught our attention was the requirement that government software should contain a machine-readable <strong>Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)</strong>, defined as \"a formal record containing the details and supply chain relationships of various components used in building software.\" In other words, it should detail not just the components shipped but also the tools and frameworks used to deliver the software. This order has the potential to usher in a new era of transparency and openness in software development. This will undoubtedly have an impact on those of us who produce software for a living. Many, if not all software products produced today contain open-source components or employ them in the build process. Often, the consumer has no way of knowing which version of which package might have an impact on the security of their product. Instead they must rely on the security alerts and patches provided by the retail vendor. This executive order will ensure that an explicit description of all components is made available to consumers, empowering them to implement their own security controls. And since the SBOM is machine-readable, those controls can be automated. We sense that this move also represents a shift toward embracing open-source software and practically addressing both the security risks and benefits that it provides.</p>",

Firstly, many examples of this have resulted in reputational damage, for example, where an incorrect alert has been sent from a test system to an entire client population. Secondly, the level of security, specifically around protection of private data, tends to be less for test systems. There is little point in having elaborate controls around access to production data if that data is copied to a test database that can be accessed by every developer and QA. Although you <em>can</em> obfuscate the data, this tends to be applied only to specific fields, for example, credit card numbers. Finally, copying production data to test systems can break privacy laws, for example, where test systems are hosted or accessed from a different country or region. This last scenario is especially problematic with complex cloud deployments. Fake data is a safer approach, and tools exist to help in its creation. We do recognize there are reasons for <em>specific</em> elements of production data to be copied, for example, in the reproduction of bugs or for training of specific ML models.

The proxy is quite full-featured, although, as with any such adapter tool, we recommend caution and a clear-eyed view of the trade-offs involved. We believe the proxy is valuable when it enables legacy producers to send events, but would be careful creating event consumers through the proxy as the abstraction gets more complex. The proxy doesn't change the fact that Kafka consumers are stateful, which means that consumer instances created through the REST API are tied to a specific proxy, and the need to make an HTTP call to consume messages from a topic changes the standard semantics of Kafka eventing.</p>",

Although machine-learning models can make predictions based on factual data, exploiting the correlation of variables that were present at the time, they're insufficient in scenarios where we need to ask <em>What if</em> and <em>Why</em> questions: <em>What if a variable changed? What would be the impact on the outcome?</em> Causal inference is an approach to answer such questions. It estimates the causal effect, that is, the magnitude by which an outcome would change, if we changed one of the causal variables. This approach is applied when we can't arrive at the answer through observations and collecting data from A/B testing — due to the cost of experiments or limitations. The DoWhy library estimates the causal effect based on a process that uses the past collected facts and data as well as assumptions one can make knowing the domain. It uses a four-step process of modeling the causal relationships graph based on assumptions, identifying a cause for an outcome, estimating the causal effect and finally challenging those assumptions by refuting the result. We've used this library successfully in production, and it's one of the commonly used libraries in causal estimation use cases.</p>",

Like many UI testing frameworks, it provides an API to locate interface elements, either by specifying a path through the view hierarchy or by using a set of finder methods. These tests are usually simpler than XCUITests, and they run much faster. As a word of caution, though, given the ease with which tests can be written using ViewInspector, you might be tempted to over-test the interface. Testing simple one-to-one mappings is just double-entry bookkeeping. And even though ViewInspector makes it easier to test the SwiftUI code, remember to keep most of the logic in the model.</p>",

In our last Radar we mentioned <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/kube-managed-cloud-services\">Kube-managed cloud services</a> as a technique, and Crossplane does just that. The idea is to leverage the Kubernetes control plane to provision cloud services on which your deployment is dependent, even if they aren't deployed on the cluster itself. Examples include managed database instances, load balancers or access control policies. This tool is noteworthy for two reasons. First, it demonstrates the powerful and flexible execution environment of the underlying Kubernetes control plane. There is no real limit to the range of supported custom resources. Second, Crossplane provides an alternative to the usual options of <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/tools/terraform\">Terraform</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/aws-cloud-development-kit\">CDK</a> or <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/pulumi\">Pulumi</a>. Crossplane comes with a set of predefined providers for the major cloud services that cover the most commonly provisioned services. It isn't trying to be a general-purpose infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tool but rather a companion to workloads being deployed in Kubernetes. Often associated with the practice of <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/gitops\">GitOps</a>, Crossplane stands on its own and allows you to stay within the Kubernetes ecosystem when it's necessary to manage external cloud resources.

We're still observing misguided approaches with tools that help teams measure these metrics based purely on their continuous delivery (CD) pipelines. In particular when it comes to the stability metrics (MTTR and change fail percentage), CD pipeline data alone doesn't provide enough information to determine what a deployment failure with real user impact is. Stability metrics only make sense if they include data about real incidents that degrade service for the users.</p>\n\n<p>We recommend always to keep in mind the ultimate intention behind a measurement and use it to reflect and learn.

Much like scaffolding might be built, reconfigured and finally removed during construction or renovation of a building, you often need interim architectural steps during legacy displacement. Transitional architectures will be removed or replaced later on, but they're not just throwaway work given the important role they play in reducing risk and allowing a difficult problem to be broken into smaller steps. Thus they help with avoiding the trap of defaulting to a \"big bang\" legacy replacement approach, because you cannot make smaller interim steps line up with a final architectural vision. Care is needed to make sure the architectural \"scaffolding\" is eventually removed, lest it just become technical debt later on.</p>",

There is little point in having elaborate controls around access to production data if that data is copied to a test database that can be accessed by every developer and QA. Although you <em>can</em> obfuscate the data, this tends to be applied only to specific fields, for example, credit card numbers.

Metaflow provides Python APIs that structure the code as a directed graph of steps. Each step can be decorated with flexible configurations such as the required compute and storage resources. Code and data artifacts for each step's run (aka task) are stored and can be retrieved either for future runs or the next steps in the flow, enabling you to recover from errors, repeat runs and track  versions of models and their dependencies across multiple runs.</p>\n\n<p>The value proposition of Metaflow is the simplicity of its idiomatic Python library: it fully integrates with the build and run-time infrastructure to enable running data engineering and science tasks in local and scaled production environments. At the time of writing, Metaflow is heavily integrated with AWS services such as S3 for its data store service and step functions for orchestration. Metaflow supports R in addition to Python. Its core features are open sourced.</p>\n\n<p>If you're building and deploying your production ML and data-processing pipelines on AWS, Metaflow is a lightweight full-stack alternative framework to more complex platforms such as <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/tools/mlflow\">MLflow</a>.</p>",

Complex pipelines create developer friction when they run too slow or suffer from nondeterminism, reducing important feedback loops and hindering developer effectiveness. Additionally, their role as critical deployment infrastructure creates stress points during periods of rapid deployments, as happened to several organizations responding to the recent log4shell vulnerability. The concept of traces translates nicely to pipelines: instead of capturing the cascade of service calls, child spans capture information about each stage of the build.

Server-driven UI separates the rendering into a generic container in the mobile app while the structure and data for each view is provided by the server. This means that changes that once required a round trip to an app store can now be accomplished via simple changes to the responses the server sends. While some very large mobile app teams have had great success with this technique, it also requires a substantial investment in building and maintaining a complex proprietary framework. Such an investment requires a compelling business case. Until the case is made, it might be best to proceed with caution; indeed, we've experienced some horrendous, overly configurable messes that didn't actually deliver on the promised benefits. But with the backing of behemoths such as Airbnb and Lyft, we may very well see some useful frameworks emerge that help tame the complexity. Watch this space.</p>",

Two years and one pandemic later, the demand for cryptographically secure, privacy-respecting and machine-verifiable electronic credentials has grown and, as a result, governments are starting to wake up to VC's potential.

This decentralized approach also enables users to better manage and selectively disclose their own information which greatly improves data privacy protection. For example, powered by zero-knowledge proof technology, you can construct a verifiable credential to prove that you're an adult without revealing your birthday.

If an organization sets out to create a collection of small services that can be developed, built, deployed and operated independently but consistently, it makes sense to give teams a solid starting point that aligns to the standard.

The level of analysis made possible by Overwatch is deeper than what is allowed by cloud providers' cost analysis tools. For example, we were able to analyze the cost of job failures — recognizing that failing fast saves money compared to jobs that only fail near the final step — and break down the cost by various groupings (workspace, cluster, job, notebook, team). We also appreciated the improved operational visibility, as we could easily audit access controls around cluster configurations and analyze operational metrics like finding the longest running notebook or largest read/write volume.

The thinking is clear: more efficient software needs less electricity and fewer servers, reducing the emissions from electricity generation and manufacturing of the servers. An additional strategy is to make the application <em>carbon aware</em>. This is because the same workload does not always have the same carbon footprint. For example, when run in a data center in a cooler climate, less power for air conditioning is needed; or, when run at a time when more renewable energy is available (more sunshine, stronger winds), less electricity from carbon-based  sources is required.

In this approach, we get ChatGPT to generate tests for us, and then a developer implements the functionality. Specifically, we first describe the tech stack and the design patterns we're using in a prompt \"fragment\" that is reusable across multiple use cases. Then we describe the specific feature we want to implement, including the acceptance criteria. Based on all that, we ask ChatGPT to generate an implementation plan for that feature in our architectural style and tech stack. Once we sanity check that implementation plan, we ask it to generate tests for our acceptance criteria.</p>\n\n<p>This approach has worked surprisingly well for us: It required the team to come up with a concise description of their architectural style and helped junior developers and new team members code features aligned with the team’s existing style. The main drawback of this approach is that even though we don't give the model our source code, we still feed it potentially sensitive information such as our tech stack and feature descriptions. Teams should ensure they're working with their legal advisors to avoid any intellectual property issues, at least until a \"for business\" version of these AI tools becomes available.</p>",

Our teams have reported that maintaining and testing Lambda pinball architectures can be very challenging: understanding the infrastructure, deployment, diagnosis and debugging can become difficult. At a code level, simple mapping between domain concepts and the multiple Lambdas involved is practically impossible, making any changes and additions challenging. Although we believe serverless is the right fit for some problems and domains, it's not a \"silver bullet\" for every problem, which is why you should try to avoid Lambda pinball. One pattern that can help is to draw a distinction between public and published interfaces and apply domain boundaries with published interfaces between them.</p>",

Reserving some capacity during sprint planning generally leads to better predictability <em>and</em> better quality; it promotes team resilience to unexpected events like illnesses, production issues, unexpected product requests and tech debt, while also allowing productive activities like team building and ideation that can lead to product innovation. Running at less than full utilization means teams can be more thoughtful about the robustness of the resulting software and pay closer attention to the right observability signals. Our experience is that a fully utilized team leads to a collapse in throughput as well, just as a fully utilized highway creates slow and demoralizing traffic. For example, when one of our teams had unpredictable support issues, they saw a 25% increase in throughput and a 50% decrease in cycle time volatility by planning feature velocity based on only two of the three developer pairs' capacities.</p>",

Evolved from the corporate style guides of the past, design systems offer shared libraries and documents that are easy to find and use. Generally, guidance is written down as code and kept under version control so that the guide is less ambiguous and easier to maintain than simple documents. Design systems have become a standard approach when working across teams and disciplines in product development because they allow teams to focus. They can address strategic challenges around the product itself without reinventing the wheel every time a new visual component is needed.</p>\n\n<p>Our experiences show that teams seldom apply a product-centric mindset when building design systems. The primary consumers of the shared libraries and documents are the product development teams. When applying a product mindset, system owners should establish empathy with internal consumers (the development teams) and collaborate with them. We've found that the reason many component libraries are maligned is because the owning team wasn't able to give consumers what they needed fast enough and wasn't set up to take outside contributions.

Even with the continual evolution of tools and techniques in this area, <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/tools/terraform\">Terraform</a> continues to be the dominant tool for doing IaC on cloud-native resources. However, most hosting environments today are complex combinations of cloud vendor–native services, third-party services and custom code. In these environments, we've found that engineers often resort to a mixture of Terraform for cloud resources and custom scripts for the rest. This can lead to a lack of consistency and repeatability in the provisioning process. In fact, many of the third-party services that are commonly used in hosting environments — including Splunk, Datadog, PagerDuty and New Relic — have Terraform providers that you can use to provision and configure these services. That's why we recommend that, in addition to cloud resources, teams also <strong>provision monitors and alerts with Terraform</strong>. This leads to IaC with better modularity that is easier to understand and maintain. As with all IaC, there is a risk of introducing inconsistencies when the configuration is changed via other interfaces. To ensure that the Terraform code remains the source of truth, we recommend you disable configuration changes via user interfaces and APIs.</p>",

Worse than the issues with developer experience is the user experience: Page load performance is impacted when custom web components have to be loaded and hydrated in the browser, and even with pre-rendering and careful tweaking of the component, a \"flash of unstyled content\" or some layout shifting is all but unavoidable.

Following a published methodology, CCF combines these into emission estimates and provides a visualization of the data over time. Cloud providers have started adding similar offerings to their platforms, but <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/clients/Bringing-green-cloud-optimization-to-a-green-energy-business\">organizations</a> are still deploying CCF because it has all of the following features: It's open-source, designed to be extended, works across multiple clouds and has a transparent, published methodology. In addition, it also includes estimates for scope 2 and scope 3 emissions — for electricity use and hardware production, respectively. In our experiments, the estimates between different tools have varied, which is not a huge surprise given that all tools in this space make estimates and multiply estimated numbers. However, settling on one tool, taking a baseline and improving from that baseline is the key usage scenario we've come across, and tools like <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/tools/kepler\">Kepler</a> may reduce the need for estimates in the future.

At the end of the test, Terratest can undeploy the apps and clean up resources. Our teams report that this approach of testing deployed infrastructure components fosters confidence in the infrastructure as code. We see our teams writing a variety of infra security tests for application components and their integrations. These include detecting misconfigurations, verifying access control (e.g., to check whether certain IAM roles or permissions are correctly configured or to ensure only authorized users have access to specific resources) and network security tests to verify prevention of unauthorized traffic to sensitive resources to name a few. This allows security testing to be shifted left and provides feedback during development itself.</p>",

Manually checking for security vulnerabilities and adhering to regulations can slow down development and introduce errors. As an alternative, organizations can automate compliance checks and audits. They can integrate tools into software development pipelines, allowing teams to detect and address compliance issues early in the development process. Codifying compliance rules and best practices helps enforce policies and standards consistently across teams. It enables you to scan code changes for vulnerabilities, enforce coding standards and track infrastructure configuration changes to ensure they meet compliance requirements. Lastly, automated reporting of the above simplifies audits and provides clear evidence of compliance.

Opens in new tab\" class=\"pop-out\">bliki entry<span class=\"pop-out-icon\"></span></a> on the subject which indicates a test that requires live versions of all run-time dependencies. Such a test is obviously expensive, because it requires a full-featured test environment with all the necessary infrastructure, data and services. Managing the right versions of all those dependencies requires significant coordination overhead, which tends to slow down release cycles. Finally, the tests themselves are often fragile and unhelpful. For example, it takes effort to determine if a test failed because of the new code, mismatched version dependencies or the environment, and the error message rarely helps pinpoint the source of the error. Those criticisms don't mean that we take issue with automated \"black box\" integration testing in general, but we find a more helpful approach is one that balances the need for confidence with release frequency. This can be done in two stages by first validating the behavior of the system under test assuming a certain set of responses from run-time dependencies, and then validating those assumptions. The first stage uses service virtualization to create test doubles of run-time dependencies and validates the behavior of the system under test.

It can be tempting to roll out an LLM-based solution as soon as it’s more or less working and then move on.

Many problems that an LLM can solve — such as sentiment analysis or content classification — can be solved more cheaply and easily using traditional natural language processing (NLP).

Although alternatives such as <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/pulumi\">Pulumi</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/aws-cloud-development-kit\">CDK</a> and, more recently, <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/winglang\">Wing</a> have emerged, Terraform's modular, declarative paradigm has proven to be the most enduring. Indeed, all of these approaches share the common goal of modular code creating monolithic infrastructure. <strong><a href=\"https://www.systeminit.com/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"System Initiative. This is an external link. Opens in new tab\" class=\"pop-out\">System Initiative<span class=\"pop-out-icon\"></span></a></strong> is a new, experimental tool that represents a radical new direction for DevOps work. One way to view System Initiative is as a digital twin for your infrastructure. Interactive changes to the System Initiative state result in corresponding change sets that can be applied to the infrastructure itself. Likewise, changes to the infrastructure are reflected in the System Initiative state. One of the great advantages of this approach is the collaborative environment it creates for things like application deployment and observability. Engineers interact with System Initiative through a user interface that has a graphical representation of the entire environment. In addition to managing the cloud infrastructure, you can also use the tool to manage containers, scripts, tools and more. Although we're generally skeptical of these kinds of GUI tools, System Initiative can be extended to handle new assets or enforce policy via TypeScript code. We really like the creative thinking that has gone into this tool and hope it will encourage others to break with the status quo of infrastructure-as-code approaches. System Initiative is free and open source under an Apache 2.0 license and is currently in open beta. The maintainers themselves do not recommend the tool for production use yet, but we think it’s worth checking out in its current state to experience a completely different approach to DevOps tooling.</p>",

While the framework offers a powerful set of features for building applications with large language models (LLMs), we’ve found it to be hard to use and overcomplicated. LangChain gained early popularity and attention in the space, which turned it into a default for many developers. However, as LangChain is trying to evolve and keep up with the fast pace of change, it has become harder and harder to navigate those changes of concepts and patterns as a developer. We’ve also found the API design to be inconsistent and verbose. As such, it often obscures what is actually going on under the hood, making it hard for developers to understand and control how LLMs and the various patterns around them actually work. We’re moving LangChain to the Hold ring to reflect this. In many of our use cases, we’ve found that an implementation with minimum use of specialized frameworks is sufficient.

This results in higher quality output and greatly reduced hallucinations. The context window — which determines the maximum size of the LLM input — has grown significantly with newer models, but selecting the most relevant documents is still a crucial step. Our experience indicates that a carefully constructed smaller context can yield better results than a broad and large context. Using a large context is also slower and more expensive.

We use <a href=\"https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat/blob/main/docs/vllm_integration.md\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"vLLM model workers. This is an external link. Opens in new tab\" class=\"pop-out\">vLLM model workers<span class=\"pop-out-icon\"></span></a> for their high throughput capabilities. Depending on the use case — latency or throughput — different types of FastChat model workers can be created and scaled. For example, the model used for code suggestions in developer IDEs requires low latency and can be scaled with multiple FastChat workers to handle concurrent requests efficiently. In contrast, the model used for <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/text-to-sql\">Text-to-SQL</a> doesn't need multiple workers due to lower demand or different performance requirements. Our teams leverage FastChat's scaling capabilities for A/B testing. We configure FastChat workers with the same model but different hyperparameter values and pose identical questions to each, identifying optimal hyperparameter values. When transitioning models in live services, we conduct A/B tests to ensure seamless migration. For example, we recently migrated from <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/codellama/CodeLlama-70b-hf\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"CodeLlama 70B. This is an external link.

By running both models concurrently and comparing outputs, we verified the new model met or exceeded the previous model's performance without disrupting the developer experience.</p>",

Despite the potential for LVMs to revolutionize the way we work with visual data, we still face significant challenges in adapting and applying them in production environments. Video data, for instance, presents unique engineering challenges for collecting training data, segmenting and labeling objects, fine-tuning models and then deploying the resulting models and monitoring them in production.

Our advice when it comes to secrets management has always been to <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/decoupling-secret-management-from-source-code\">decouple it from source code</a>. However, when faced with a choice between full automation (in the spirit of <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/infrastructure-as-code\">infrastructure as code</a>) and a few manual steps (using tools like vaults) for managing, seeding and rotating seed secrets, teams often face a tradeoff. For example, our teams use SOPS to manage seed credentials for bootstrapping infrastructure. In some situations, however, it's impossible to remove secrets from legacy code repositories. In those instances, we use SOPS to encrypt secrets in text files. SOPS integrates with cloud-managed keystores such as AWS and GCP Key Management Service (KMS) or Azure Key Vault as sources of encryption keys. It also works cross-platform and supports PGP keys. Several of our teams use SOPS by default when they have to manage secrets in the code repository.</p>",

It does this by tracking uncommitted file changes independently of Git and then staging those changes into virtual branches. One might argue that this is a solution to a problem that shouldn't exist in the first place; if you make small changes and push to trunk frequently, there’s no need for multiple branches. However, when your workflow involves pull requests, the branching structure can become complex, particularly if there is a long review cycle before a PR can be merged. To address this, GitButler also integrates with GitHub so you can selectively group changes into pull requests and issue them directly from the tool. GitButler is another entry into the growing category of blips aimed at managing the complexity inherent in the PR process.</p>",

These coding assistance tools do more than just help the engineer with code snippets here and there; they broaden the size of the problem they can solve, ideally autonomously and with minimum interference from a human. The idea is that these tools can take a GitHub issue or a Jira ticket and propose a plan and code changes to implement it, or even create a pull request for a human to review. While this is the next logical step to increase the impact of AI coding assistance, the often advertised goal of generic agents that can cover a broad range of coding tasks is very ambitious, and the current state of tooling is not showing that convincingly yet.

You can define the intended output structure and configure retries if the LLM doesn't return the structure you asked for. As the best end user experience for working with LLMs is often to stream the results to them instead of waiting for the full response, Instructor also takes care of parsing partial structures from a stream.</p>",

However, these models should be seen as a distinct category of LLMs rather than simply more advanced versions.</p>\n\n<p>This increased capability comes at a cost. Reasoning models require longer response time and higher token consumption, leading us to jokingly call them \"Slower AI\" (as if current AI wasn’t slow enough). Not all tasks justify this trade-off. For simpler tasks like text summarization, content generation or fast-response chatbots, general-purpose LLMs remain the better choice. We advise using reasoning models in STEM fields, complex problem-solving and decision-making — for example, when using <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/llm-as-a-judge\">LLMs as judges</a> or improving explainability through explicit CoT outputs.

    "descriptionHtml": "<p>Since we last wrote about <strong>software engineering agents</strong> six months ago, the industry still lacks a shared definition of the term \"agent.\" However, a major development has emerged — not in fully autonomous coding agents (which remain unconvincing) but in supervised agentic modes within the IDE. These modes allow developers to drive implementation via chat, with tools not only modifying code in multiple files but also executing commands, running tests and responding to IDE feedback like linting or compile errors.</p>\n\n<p>This approach, sometimes called chat-oriented programming (CHOP) or prompt-to-code, keeps developers in control while shifting more responsibility to AI than traditional coding assistants like auto-suggestions. Leading tools in this space include <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/tools/cursor\">Cursor</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/tools/cline\">Cline</a> and <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/tools/windsurf\">Windsurf</a>, with <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/tools/github-copilot\">GitHub Copilot</a> slightly behind but catching up.

However, keeping problem scopes small helps developers better review AI-generated changes. This works best with low-abstraction prompts and <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/ai-friendly-code-design\">AI-friendly codebases</a> that are well-structured and properly tested. As these modes improve, they’ll also heighten the risk of <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/complacency-with-ai-generated-code\">complacency with AI-generated code</a>.

In rack-scale systems like NVIDIA’s NVL72, 72 GPUs share over 13 TB of VRAM and act as a single accelerator — until workloads cross-switch islands, turning collective operations into bottlenecks. Similarly, Groq’s compile-time, software-scheduled architecture assumes deterministic data movement; random scheduling breaks those assumptions and predictability. Even within the same data center, GPU performance can vary significantly, creating demand for <strong>topology-aware scheduling</strong> that accounts for both hardware layout and variability when placing jobs.</p>\n<p>Naive schedulers that ignore NVLink, PCIe or NIC topology often scatter multi-GPU workloads arbitrarily, resulting in degraded step time and efficiency. Training workloads, which are synchronous and bandwidth-bound, favor contiguous NVLink islands with uniform, high-bandwidth paths for all-reduce and pipeline stages. These jobs should co-schedule based on fabric bandwidth, avoid cross-switch hops and treat link, switch and node boundaries as failure domains. Inference workloads, by contrast, are latency and SLO-bound and typically balance replication for high availability across domains with sharding to keep mixture of experts (MoE) and KV-cache locality on the shortest paths. Optimizing placement for prefill versus decode phases, micro-batching and tenant isolation further improves efficiency.

In our work, we've found Crossplane excels in specific use cases rather than as a general-purpose infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tool. Our earlier observations still hold true: Crossplane works best as a companion to workloads deployed within Kubernetes, not as a full replacement for tools like Terraform. Teams that went \"all-in\" on Crossplane as their primary IaC solution often struggled, whereas those using it pragmatically — for targeted, custom use-cases — saw strong results. Offloading resource lifecycle management to Crossplane while using XRD APIs for lightweight customization has proven especially effective. Crossplane is particularly valuable when managing resources whose lifecycles are straightforward but not native to Kubernetes. While it can now create Kubernetes clusters — a capability that was previously missing — we advise caution when adopting Crossplane as a complete Terraform replacement. In our experience, it works best when IaC serves as the foundational layer, with Crossplane layered on top for specialized requirements.</p>",
