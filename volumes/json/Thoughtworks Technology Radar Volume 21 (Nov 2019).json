    "description": "\"<p>Today, many organizations' answer to unlocking data for analytical usage is to build a labyrinth of data pipelines. Pipelines retrieve data from one or multiple sources, cleanse it and then transform and move it to another location for consumption. This approach to data management often leaves the consuming pipelines with the difficult task of verifying the inbound data's integrity and building complex logic to cleanse the data to meet its required level of quality. The fundamental problem is that the source of the data has no incentive and accountability for providing quality data to its consumers. For this reason, we strongly advocate for <strong>data integrity at the origin</strong>, by which we mean, any source that provides consumable data must describe its measures of data quality explicitly and guarantee those measures. The main reason behind this is that the originating systems and teams are most intimately familiar with their data and best positioned to fix it at the source. <a href=\"\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/data-mesh\"\">Data mesh</a> architecture takes this one step further, comparing consumable data to a <em>product</em>, where data quality and its objectives are integral attributes of every shared data set.</p>\""

It supports data ingestion, copying data from and to different storage types on prem or on Azure and executing transformation logic. While we've had a reasonable experience with ADF for simple migrations of data stores from on prem to cloud, we discourage the use of <strong>Azure Data Factory for orchestration</strong> of complex data-processing pipelines. Our experience has been challenging due to several factors, including limited coverage of capabilities that can be implemented through coding first, as it appears that ADF is prioritizing enabling <a href=\"\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/low-code-platforms\"\">low-code platform</a> capabilities first; poor debuggability and error reporting; limited observability as ADF logging capabilities don't integrate with other products such as Azure Data Lake Storage or Databricks, making it difficult to get an end-to-end observability in place; and availability of data source-triggering mechanisms only to certain regions. At this time, we encourage using other open-source orchestration tools (e.g., <a href=\"\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/tools/airflow\"\">Airflow</a>) for complex data pipelines and limit ADF for data copying or snapshotting. We're hoping that ADF will address these concerns to support for more complex data-processing workflows and prioritize access to capabilities through code first.</p>\""

    "description": "\"<p>When teams embrace the concept of <a href=\"\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/micro-frontends\"\">micro frontends</a> they have a number of patterns at their disposal to integrate the individual micro frontends into one application. As always there are antipatterns, too. A common one in this case is <strong>front-end integration via artifact</strong>. For each micro frontend an artifact is built, usually an NPM package, which is pushed into a registry. A later step, sometimes in a different build pipeline, then combines the individual packages into a final package that contains all micro frontends. From a purely technical perspective this integration at build time results in a working application. However, integrating via artifact implies that for each change the full artifact needs to be rebuilt, which is time consuming and will likely have a negative impact on developer experience. Worse, this style of integrating frontends also introduces direct dependencies between the micro frontends at build time and therefore causes considerable coordination overhead.</p>\""

It has a very fast startup time (tens of milliseconds) and has low memory utilization which makes it a good candidate for FaaS or frequent scaling up and down in a container orchestrator. Like <a href=\"\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks/micronaut\"\">Micronaut</a>, Quarkus achieves this by using ahead-of-time compilation techniques to do dependency injection at compile time and avoid the runtime costs of reflection. It also works well with <a href=\"\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/graalvm\"\">GraalVM</a>'s Native Image which further reduces startup time.

We like that SwiftUI moves beyond the somewhat kludgy relationship between Interface Builder and XCode and adopts a coherent, declarative and code-centric approach. You can now view your code and the resulting visual interface side by side in XCode 11, making for a much better developer experience. The SwiftUI framework also draws inspiration from the <a href=\"\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks/react-js\"\">React.js</a> world that has dominated web development in recent years. Immutable values in view models and an asynchronous update mechanism make for a unified reactive programming model. This gives developers an entirely native alternative to similar reactive frameworks such as <a href=\"\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks/react-native\"\">React Native</a> or <a href=\"\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks/flutter\"\">Flutter</a>. Although SwiftUI definitely represents the future of Apple UI development, it is quite new and it will take time to smooth out the rough edges. We look forward to improved documentation and a community of developers who can establish a set of practices for testing and other engineering concerns.</p>\""
