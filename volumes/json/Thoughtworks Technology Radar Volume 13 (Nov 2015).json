Something written in .NET is then an implementation detail, you can install a .NET dependency into any environment. A .NET tool is no different than something written in C from an external dependency perspective, making it a much more attractive option for general purpose applications and utilities. CoreFX is also being factored into individual NuGet dependencies, so that applications can pull what they need, keeping the footprint for .NET applications and libraries small and making it easier to replace part of the framework.</p>\""

Kylin is intended to be a Hadoop based hybrid OLAP (HOLAP) solution that will eventually support both MOLAP and ROLAP style multidimensional analysis. With Kylin you can define cubes using a Cube Designer and initiate an offline process that builds these cubes. The offline process performs a pre-join step to join facts and dimension tables into a flattened out structure. This is followed by a pre-aggregation phase where individual cuboids are built using Map Reduce jobs. The results are stored in HDFS sequence files and are later loaded into HBase. The data requests can originate from SQL submitted using a SQL-based tool. The query engine (based on <strong>Apache Calcite</strong> ), determines if the target dataset exists in HBase. If so, the engine directly accesses the target data from HBase and returns the result with sub-second latency. If not, the engine routes the queries to <strong>Hive</strong> (or any other SQL on Hadoop solution enabled on the cluster).</p>\""
