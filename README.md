# Thoughtworks Technology Radar - Datasets
A collection of datasets for the [latest Thoughtworks Technology Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar) and all [archived volumes](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/archive)

### How to use with build-your-own-radar

You can use any of the `volumes/*` datasets with either
- self-hosted [thoughtworks/build-your-own-radar](https://github.com/thoughtworks/build-your-own-radar#using-csv-data)
- hosted https://radar.thoughtworks.com/

Remember, you will need to use the GitHub RAW file URL for these to work while hosted in GitHub (eg: [Volume 27](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/setchy/thoughtworks-tech-radar-volumes/main/volumes/Thoughtworks%20Technology%20Radar%20Volume%2027.csv))
