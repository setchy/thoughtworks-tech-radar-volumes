Automation of technical tests,trial,techniques,TRUE,new,"Significant advances in the tools for automating functional testing haven’t been replicated in the technical testing space. Data management for performance, load and soak testing is a particular issue. However, the tools are improving and increased visibility for these tools supports the early and often technical testing that we advocate."

Lean software development,trial,techniques,FALSE,no change,"As Agile practices move further toward mainstream adoption, we see significant benefits from the adoption of Lean software development practices as well. These practices have their roots in the Toyota Production System and complement much of our understanding of Agile software development to date. One topic that Lean has also given us greater insight into is that of set-based design. Set-based design leads us to implement similar solutions at the same time while the cost of doing so is constrained. This leads us into the area of emergent design and the ability to let experience shape our design decisions and defer key decisions until the last responsible moment."

Large format mobile devices,assess,platforms,TRUE,new,"Large format mobile devices, such as the Apple iPad and Amazon Kindle, provide a new model of ubiquitous computing. Their long battery life, simple interfaces and easy connectivity have the potential to change the way we interact with computers. Apple’s new user interfaces discard the familiar desktop metaphors of files and folders that have been standard since the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984."

OAuth,assess,platforms,TRUE,new,"The Web is a global data structure that enables us to share information. However not all data is meant to be shared by everyone and it’s important to be able to share information on the Web in a disciplined and governable manner without requiring massive centralized infrastructure. OAuth provides a way of sharing resources on the Web responsibly and securely. It is a Web protocol (for Web browsers or machine-to-machine interactions), which allows federated authorization of access to Web resources. What’s interesting is that OAuth is a simple protocol to implement and utilize and yet its design goals match many common enterprise authorization problems. OAuth remains in the assessment category, however, because it has fragmented, and the IETF has not yet drawn the community back together under an Internet RFC."
RDFa,assess,platforms,FALSE,no change,"Semantic Web W3C standards, and the tools implementing them, are at last worthy of real attention. RDF and RDFa allow anyone to say anything about anything in a sharable, structured format. This proves a much more powerful means of linking and structuring data from disparate sources than the strictness of RDBMS, or the mess that is unstructured Web data. Correspondingly SPARQL is the query standard that allows information to be mined from RDF marked-up data."

GWT,hold,platforms,TRUE,new,"Google Web Toolkit (GWT) offers an interesting premise: write Swing-like Java code and generate unit testable JavaScript widgets and user interfaces. From a practical standpoint this doesn’t work well. First, using code-gen to produce the artifacts is time consuming, artificially extending build times and requiring manual changes to obtain optimal package layout. Second, if the JavaScript doesn’t behave exactly as you want you will have to hack the generated code. Third, using Java to generate JavaScript means that you can’t take direct advantage of the powerful features of JavaScript or numerous libraries such as JQuery. Finally, the JUnit support is quite limited, for example code using reflection cannot be tested."

Distributed version control,trial,tools,FALSE,no change,"Subversion moves back into the Adopt section of the radar because it is a solid version control tool suitable for most teams. We consider Subversion’s features to be the basic standard for a modern version control tool. Thoughtworkers continue to embrace and recommend Distributed Version Control tools such as Git and Mercurial, but we caution that these systems often require deeper understanding to get the most out of them. New to the radar is GitHub, a “social coding” tool supporting both source code hosting and social networking. GitHub is arguably one of the main reasons Git has become the leading DVCS tool, and GitHub’s collaboration features are often used by enterprises that need to support distributed teams."
