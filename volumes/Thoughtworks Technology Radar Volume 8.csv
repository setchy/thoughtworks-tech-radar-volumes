Aggregates as documents,adopt,techniques,no change,"When designing a domain model, the aggregate pattern helps to add structure and modularity. Mapped to a relational database the aggregate is not visible in the table structure. Document databases, like MongoDB, allow you to model aggregates as documents. This 1:1 mapping means that the aggregate root should be the object that is loaded from the collection."
Automated deployment pipeline,adopt,techniques,no change,"The adoption of Continuous Delivery means many teams are creating an automated deployment pipeline that carries their code all the way to production. Pipelines allow the visualization of otherwise complex chains of build and deployment activities. Further, they provide the ability to reliably trace build artifacts as they progress through each stage on their path to production. Several vendors are now building CI servers that support the pipeline as a first-class feature and not just a visual element. We recommend teams look closely at these products to avoid wasting time trying to shoehorn a pipeline into a tool without adequate support."
Guerrilla user testing,adopt,techniques,no change,"Bringing users in to a controlled environment for formal testing can be a slow and expensive proposition. Much useful, qualitative feedback can be gathered quickly and cheaply through guerrilla user testing - by going out into the world and testing with small samples of the general public. Another alternative is remote usability testing, where you can send out everything from wireframes to final applications for testing by people all over the world. Usabila, Loop11 and Treejack all provide tools where you can ask users to carry out specific tasks, and capture everything from the time taken to complete a task, to the user’s thoughts and feelings while doing so."
In-process acceptance testing,adopt,techniques,no change,"Acceptance tests generally exercise the system from the ‘outside’, traversing an entire network stack for the security of exercising the complete application. In-process acceptance testing challenges the notion that test code and application under- test must run in different processes in order to achieve these benefits. When using an embedded container, it is easy to set up the system, run the tests over HTTP and to verify the final state without the setup costs associated with deploying to and communicating with a separate container."
Mobile testing on mobile networks,adopt,techniques,new,""
Performance testing as a first-class citizen,adopt,techniques,moved in,"While unit and acceptance testing are widely embraced as standard development practices, this trend has not continued into the realm of performance testing. Currently, the common tooling drives testers towards creating throw away code and a click-and-script mentality. Treating performance testing as a first-class citizen enables the creation of better tests that cover more functionality, leading to better tooling to create and run performance tests, resulting in a test suite that is maintainable and can itself be tested."
Promises for asynchronous programming,adopt,techniques,new,"The use of promises for asynchronous programming is an old technique that is also known as futures. It is gaining renewed interest in light of the extensive use of JavaScript on both the client and server side. This technique eliminates the use of deeply nested callbacks, flags and pollers and has first-class support from libraries such as jQuery. Teams developing JavaScript codebases of significant complexity should take advantage of this."

Analyzing test runs,trial,techniques,new,"Failing tests reveal bugs in production code. However, analyzing test runs for other properties can reveal interesting information. A simple example would be to monitor which tests fail frequently and run them earlier in your build pipeline to get fast feedback. Similarly, tracking other properties such as test execution times and ratios of long-running tests to fast-tests can provide actionable metrics."
Blue-green deployment,trial,techniques,new,"Blue-green deployment is a pattern for performing software upgrades. By setting up the latest version of your application on an identical clone of your production application stack, traffic can be switched, near instantaneously, from the current production stack to the new one as soon as the test suite and the business determine it is appropriate. Though this is an old technique, infrastructure automation and resources in the cloud make it worth reconsidering."
Co-location by telepresence,trial,techniques,new,"Increasing quality and range of choices for inexpensive or free video conferencing is leading to a new way of working for distributed teams. Always-on video connections can help create a sense of co-location by telepresence, even when the team is distributed geographically. This is becoming the defacto standard in some of our offshore delivery centers. We are also seeing increased use of screen-sharing tools like ScreenHero for remote pairing. We would caution those looking for a silver bullet to eliminate the need for physical co-location. There is no substitute for the understanding and empathy created by faceto- face communication."
Continuous delivery for mobile devices,trial,techniques,new,"With HTML5 blurring the line between traditional native apps and web apps, we are beginning to experiment with continuous delivery for mobile devices. Services such as TestFlight allow you to deploy native apps to real devices multiple times per day. With a wholly or partially HTML5-based application changes can be deployed without submitting a new app to an app store. If your organization has an enterprise app store, you may be able to easily push builds to it. While the techniques for implementing CD to mobile devices are improving, we note that testing practices are lagging behind. To be successful you will need to increase your focus on automated testing to ensure that everything actually works once it gets to the device."
Database migrations for NoSQL,trial,techniques,new,"NoSQL data stores continue to become mainstream, and teams should acknowledge the need for database migrations for NoSQL. Especially with an implicit or dynamic schema you are likely to want to reconfigure data over time. There are several approaches such as running an explicit migration when deploying a new build of your application, or using dynamic migrations in code as documents are loaded and processed."
Edge Side Includes for page composition,trial,techniques,no change,"Breaking up monolithic applications and building systems from microservices requires a solid strategy to integrate output from disparate systems into a coherent experience for the end-user. Integrating at the presentation layer using Edge Side Includes (ESI) for page composition is a practical and elegant solution. This can occur within your environment using a reverse proxy like Varnish or closer to the user in a Content Delivery Network (CDN)."

Logs as data,trial,techniques,no change,"Log files generated by web servers, databases, networking infrastructure, and back-end systems are a valuable source of operational and behavioral data for a business. In the past, these files were mostly viewed as a source of diagnostic information in the case of failure, but with lowered cost of storage, and availability of tools such as Splunk for indexing and retrieving millions of events, they can also be a source of customer insights. Treating logs as data and storing complete logs instead of just collecting predefined metrics provides a means to answer novel questions that a business could not have previously anticipated."

Mobile first,trial,techniques,no change,"We are rapidly heading towards a world where the majority of consumer interactions are from mobile devices. Mobile first embraces this trend by designing user interfaces and server interactions that target mobile devices in the first instance. The mobile first strategy contrasts with approaches that assume a highly capable client device connected to a fast and reliable network and then degrade the experience to fit the limitations of the device."

Responsive web design,trial,techniques,no change,"One such technique for achieving this is responsive web design. Starting with a basic presentation of content - and typically keeping the essential information constant - the experience is enhanced to suit the features detected on more capable browsers. This commonly takes the form of layout and format changes based on screen size."
Semantic monitoring,trial,techniques,no change,"Development teams typically produce tests that specify and validate application behavior, but stop running them once the application goes into production. This is a missed opportunity. Semantic monitoring uses your tests to continuously evaluate your application, combining test-execution and realtime monitoring. With microservices, and similar fine-grained architectural approaches, it is increasingly important to test their interaction at run-time. Incorporating the validation of consumer-driven contracts into a monitoring facility is one way to approach this. While still evolving, we see great promise in the merging of two separate but important verification schemes."

Exhaustive browser based testing,hold,techniques,no change,"We have previously spoken about executing automated tests at the appropriate layer of your application. In this radar, we want to be very specific - we recommend against exhaustive browser based testing. Web browser automation tools like Selenium have encouraged widespread automated testing through the browser. While these tests continue to have their place in a test portfolio, most teams find that executing the bulk of tests through the browser creates a slow and fragile test suite."

BigQuery,trial,platforms,moved in,"The amount of data that even a relatively low volume website can generate is huge. Once you add in analytics, business metrics, demographics, user profiles and multiple devices, it can become overwhelming. Many organizations use data warehouses as a repository with data being sucked in from all parts of the organization. The challenge here is that these often turn into “Data Fortresses.” Even getting timely business metrics becomes a challenge, let alone running exploratory queries across the entire data set. Technologies like the cloud based BigQuery help. The pay-as-you-go model and the ability to do ad hoc queries lets you gain insight without buying specialist hardware and software. A data-driven business should put data in the hands of the decision makers, not hidden behind technological barriers and bureaucracy."
Continuous integration in the cloud,trial,platforms,no change,"Continuous integration in the cloud is one of those obvious-in-hindsight infrastructure offerings that supports agile development.

We are not excited about this just because Rackspace is a client of ours and we have had the pleasure developing the platform. We have successfully used Rackspace Cloud with several other clients, and would look forward to it being offered in more geographical locations."
Riak,trial,platforms,no change,"Riak is a distributed key-value store that is schema-less and data-type agnostic. It can be put to good use in write-heavy projects to store data such as sessions, shopping carts and streaming logs - whilst it retains the ability to perform complex queries in a full-text search. The distributed cluster can self-recover without a single master, has tuneable consistency and availability settings and can do collision detection and resolution if needed - all of which can be particularly helpful in high availability environments."

Calatrava,assess,platforms,no change,"We have previously been skeptical of claims of reusable code working across platforms. Our experience with many tools in the market has been mixed and we advise caution to our clients who are looking at these types of solutions. Taking an approach that carefully navigates these dangerous waters, we feel Calatrava is worth evaluating for mobile application development. The framework neatly follows the separation of business and presentation logic, maximising reuse where there is commonality, and providing native access where speed or device-specific idioms are to be followed."
Datomic,assess,platforms,no change,"A fundamental rethinking of how databases work, Datomic is an immutable database server with fascinating transactional and deployment characteristics. One of the common headaches on agile projects is managing database migrations, especially restoring previous states.

Capable of charting metrics in realtime, it features a round-robin database that is able to store long periods of historic data, while still providing more recent information at a higher fidelity. Numerous configuration options exist on the dashboard, and the resulting graphs can then be embedded in webpages to increase visibility."
Immutable servers,adopt,tools,no change,"Precedents set by cloud providers are now changing expectations within the corporate datacenter. In the cloud, many systems scale automatically, either to provide additional availability or in response to increased demand. Crucial to managing a growing estate, immutable servers, or ‘phoenix servers’, are a sensible approach for enterprises looking at IaaS and PaaS. In contrast, custom-configured ‘snowflake servers’ increase the load on the operations group and encourage a “works on my machine” mentality. Being able to re-provision machines - hard or virtual - from scratch using tools such as Chef or Puppet can drastically reduce the complexity of managing large server farms. Coupled with software that is designed to withstand failure, this will lead to more scalable and reliable systems."
