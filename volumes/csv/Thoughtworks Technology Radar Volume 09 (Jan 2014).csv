Capturing client-side JavaScript errors,adopt,techniques,FALSE,moved in,"Capturing client-side JavaScript errors has helped our delivery teams identify issues specific to a browser or plug-in configuration that impact user experience. Over the past year a number of service providers have started to surface in support of this requirement. Other than storing these errors in application data stores, web applications can log this data to web analytics or existing monitoring tools such as New Relic to offload storage requirements."
Continuous delivery for mobile devices,adopt,techniques,FALSE,moved in,"Since the last radar a few advances have made continuous delivery for native apps on mobile devices less painful. Xctool, the recently open-sourced 'better xcodebuild' improves iOS build automation and unit testing. The arrival of automatic updates in iOS7 reduces the friction of regular releases. Travis-CI now supports OS X agents, removing another hurdle in seamless CD pipelines for mobile platforms. Our advice from the last radar on the value of hybrid approaches and the importance of test automation for mobile still applies."
Mobile testing on mobile networks,adopt,techniques,FALSE,no change,"We increasingly see mobile applications that work really well during development and testing, but run into trouble when they are deployed in the real world. Mobile testing on mobile networks reveals how your app performs under a variety of conditions. You might test using 3G or LTE or deliberately use a poor WiFi network with overloaded access points. Measure network performance for your target environment, then simulate the conditions using latency and packet-loss inducing tools. In addition, it is sometimes necessary to examine exactly how your device and software are using the network with a tool such as Wireshark."

Windows infrastructure automation,adopt,techniques,FALSE,no change,"Previously, support for Windows in tools like Chef and Puppet was lacking, leading to large amounts of Powershell scripting to achieve simple infrastructure automation tasks. Achieving the same level of automation for Windows was more challenging than for Unix. In the last 12 months however, both Chef and Puppet support for Windows has improved drastically.  That support, combined with the inherent power of Powershell makes Windows infrastructure automation extremely viable."

HTML5 storage instead of cookies,trial,techniques,FALSE,no change,"HTML5 storage, also known as local storage or web storage, is a mechanism for storing client side data in modern browsers, including iOS and Android mobile browsers. We recommend using HTML5 storage instead of cookies in almost all cases. HTML5 Storage can accommodate up to 5MB of data while cookies are limited to 4KB. Cookie data is transmitted in every request, which slows down your application and potentially exposes data over insecure HTTP connections. In contrast, HTML5 storage data remains securely in the browser. Cookies should be reserved for storing small simple pieces of data like a session ID."
Instrument all the things,trial,techniques,TRUE,new,"You cannot act on important business events unless you monitor them.

Microservices,trial,techniques,FALSE,no change,"We are seeing an uptick in adoption of microservices as a technique for distributed system design, both in Thoughtworks and in the wider community. Frameworks such as Dropwizard and practices like declarative provisioning point to a maturing of the technologies and tools. Avoiding the usual monolithic approach and being sympathetic to the need to replace parts of systems individually has important positive implications for the total cost of ownership of systems.

Focus on mean time to recovery,assess,techniques,FALSE,no change,"In previous radars we recommended arranging automated acceptance tests into longer journeys and, in what we call semantic monitoring, running these tests continuously against a production environment. We still believe that this is an important technique for scenarios the team can anticipate in advance. A variation of this approach, seen especially with startups, is to reduce the number of tests while increasing  monitoring and automatic alarms.  This shifts the focus from avoiding problems that can be anticipated to reducing mean time to recovery for all problems."
Machine image as a build artifact,assess,techniques,FALSE,no change,"Most virtualization technologies provide a way to launch a machine from an image. By creating a machine image as a build artifact early in your build pipeline and promoting it through the pipeline as it passes further suites of tests, you can reliably deploy the exact machine that passed the tests into production. This technique eliminates most causes of the snowflake server anti-pattern."

Siloed metrics,hold,techniques,TRUE,new,"As more businesses move online we have noted a tendency to end up with siloed metrics. Specific tools are implemented to gather and display specific metrics: one tool for page-views and browser behavior, another for operational data and another to consolidate log messages. This leads to data silos and the need to swivel-chair integrate between the tools in order to gather business intelligence that is crucial to running the business. This is a tool-led split in the analytics domain that hurts the teamâ€™s ability to make decisions.

Backend as a service,assess,platforms,TRUE,new,"The recent explosion of mobile-focused products, coupled with widespread adoption of 'Lean Start-up' approaches that put a premium on time-to-market for new ideas, has spawned an ecosystem of Backend as a service (BaaS) offerings that enable developers to focus on the client application while offloading backend concerns. Assess adding these services to your toolkit where fast and low-cost proving of a new product idea is important. Our usual advice on build/buy/borrow decisions still applies: be clear on which functional areas are strategic to your business and which are commodities. For potentially strategic areas be sure to plan a migration path that will allow you to use the BaaS provider to get started quickly, while avoiding friction when your architecture evolves and you need to migrate to owning this functionality and customizing it as a differentiator."

Often this results in an unnecessary overhead for every release as other teams get involved. Expensive and limiting software licenses makes this problem even worse. Some heavyweight tools use a 'model driven' approach where an attempt is made to accurately model the usage patterns of the application, which leads to costly test script maintenance and development time being lost to 'false positives'.
