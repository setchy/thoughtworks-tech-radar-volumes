While the concept of a managed control plane and self-managed data planes offers flexibility for complex infrastructure setups (such as multi-cloud and hybrid cloud), teams have experienced control plane incidents that were only discovered internally rather than by Tyk, highlighting potential observability gaps in Tyk's AWS-hosted environment. Furthermore, the level of incident support appears slow; communicating via tickets and emails isn’t ideal in these situations. Teams have also reported issues with the maturity of Tyk's documentation, often finding it inadequate for complex scenarios and issues. Additionally, other products in the Tyk ecosystem seem immature as well, for example, the enterprise developer portal is reported to not be backward compatible and has limited customization capabilities.
