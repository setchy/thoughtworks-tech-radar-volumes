    "description": "\"<p>A few years ago, we observed <strong>Node overload</strong>: Node.js was often used for questionable reasons or without even considering any alternatives. While we understand that some teams prefer a single-language stack — despite the trade-offs — we continue to advocate for <a href=\"\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/polyglot-programming\"\">polyglot programming</a>. At the time, we noted that Node.js had a deserved reputation for efficiency in IO-heavy workloads, but we mentioned that other frameworks had caught up which offered better APIs and superior overall performance. We also cautioned that Node.js was never well-suited to compute-heavy workloads, a limitation that remains a significant challenge. Now, with the rise of data-heavy workloads, we’re seeing teams struggle with these as well.</p>\""
