Accumulate-only data,assess,techniques,FALSE,no change,"<p>Immutable data structures are becoming more popular, with functional languages such as Clojure and Scala providing immutability by default. Immutability allows code to be more easily written, read and reasoned about.

Implementation options vary, from specific accumulative data stores such as <a href=""http://www.datomic.com/"">Datomic</a> to simply using an “append-don’t-update” approach with a traditional database. <strong>Accumulate-only</strong> is a design strategy whereby data is removed via retraction rather than update; <strong>append-only</strong> is an implementation technique.</p>"

Partly inspired by “<a href=""http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/"">The Reactive Manifesto</a>”, these <strong>reactive architectures</strong> are based on a one-way, asynchronous flow of immutable events through a network of independent processes (perhaps implemented as microservices). In the right setting, these systems are scalable and resilient and decrease the coupling between individual processing units. However, architectures based entirely on asynchronous message passing introduce complexity and often rely on proprietary frameworks.

Pace-layered Application Strategy,hold,techniques,FALSE,moved out,"<p>Gartner's <strong>Pace-layered Application Strategy</strong> approach appears to be creating an unhelpful focus on the idea of layers within an architecture. We find thinking about the pace of change within different <strong>business capabilities</strong> (which can be made up of several architectural layers) to be a more useful concept. The danger in focusing on layers is that many types of change cut across multiple layers. For example, being able to add new class of stock to a website is not just about having an easy-to-change CMS; you also need to update the database, integration points, warehouse systems, etc. The recognition that some parts of an architecture need to be more maneuverable than others is useful. However, a focus on layers is proving unhelpful.</p>"

The offline process performs a pre-join step to join facts and dimension tables into a flattened out structure. This is followed by a pre-aggregation phase where individual cuboids are built using Map Reduce jobs. The results are stored in HDFS sequence files and are later loaded into HBase. The data requests can originate from SQL submitted using a SQL-based tool. The query engine (based on <strong>Apache Calcite</strong> ), determines if the target dataset exists in HBase.

For failure isolation, TLA+ can be used to identify invariants in your system that can be monitored directly. An invariant can be the ratio of number of requests to one service to the number of requests to a second service, for example. Any change in this ratio would lead to an alert. TLA+ is also being used to identify subtle design flaws in distributed systems. Amazon, for example, used model-checking based on a formal specification written in TLA+ to identify subtle bugs in Dynamo DB before it was released to the public. For most systems, the investment required to create the formal specification and then perform model checking is probably too great; however, for critical systems - complex ones, or those with many users - we think it’s very valuable to have another tool in our toolbox.</p>"
