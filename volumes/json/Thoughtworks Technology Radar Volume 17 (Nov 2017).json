We find that these platforms are most effective when they're given the same respect as an external product offering. <strong>Applying product management to internal platforms</strong> means establishing empathy with internal consumers (read: developers) and collaborating with them on the design. Platform product managers establish roadmaps and ensure the platform delivers value to the business and enhances the developer experience. Some owners even create a brand identity for the internal platform and use that to market the benefits to their colleagues. Platform product managers look after the quality of the platform, gather usage metrics, and continuously improve it over time. Treating the platform as a product helps to create a thriving ecosystem and avoids the pitfall of building yet another stagnant, underutilized service-oriented architecture.</p>\""

For instance, single-spa can be quite useful when you're working with a legacy application and you want to experiment by developing a new feature, with either a new version of the existing framework or a completely different one. Given the short life span of many JavaScript frameworks, we see a need for a solution that would allow for future framework changes and localized experimentation, without affecting the entire application. single-spa seems to be a good start in that direction.</p>\""

This is particularly useful given the range of sensor data available on mobile phones. Pretrained TensorFlow models can be loaded into a mobile application and applied to inputs such as live video frames, text or speech. Mobile phones present a surprisingly opportune platform for implementing these computational models. TensorFlow models are exported and loaded as protobuf files, which can present some problems for implementers. Protobuf's binary format can make it hard to examine models and requires that you link the correct protobuf library version to your mobile app. But local model execution offers an attractive alternative to <a href=\"\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/tensorflow-serving\"\">TensorFlow Serving</a> without the communication overhead of remote execution.</p>\""
